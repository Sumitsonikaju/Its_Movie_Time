3
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,416
A fearless prince

4
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:44,570
in the dead of the night

5
00:01:44,595 --> 00:01:46,416
began the search for his destiny.

6
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:49,666
That day, amidst the raging storm

7
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:50,874
on the ship

8
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:51,749
alone

9
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,416
without fearing anyone

10
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,208
he sailed over the glittering sea.

11
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:57,916
Mom

12
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:58,583
Hmm?

13
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,374
Why does the sea glitter?

14
00:02:01,624 --> 00:02:04,333
Because there lies an ocean of gold
beneath the sea.

15
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,458
That's why it glitters.

16
00:02:05,874 --> 00:02:06,624
Mom

17
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:09,583
Are you…so fond of gold?

18
00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:13,916
There is no woman in the world
who isn’t fond of gold.

19
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:14,874
Mom

20
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:18,833
I will fetch you all the gold
in this world.

21
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,749
Fine! Time to go to sleep now.

22
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:22,541
You can do that in the morning.

23
00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:23,374
OK?

24
00:02:23,499 --> 00:02:23,958
Hmm.

25
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:24,958
Close your eyes.

26
00:02:34,374 --> 00:02:38,124
No one shall ever read or write
anything about him.

27
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:43,083
His name and identity…

28
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:46,708
should be erased from
the pages of history.

29
00:02:48,874 --> 00:02:50,749
I am enforcing the army…

30
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,208
and signing the death warrant…

31
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,458
of the biggest criminal in India.

32
00:03:06,265 --> 00:03:08,666
Anand Ingalgi suffered a stroke
at 4am Sir.

33
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:10,374
He is in ICU at St. Mary's Hospital.

34
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:14,124
Due to high BP, there is brain hemorrhage
and lot of clots in his brain.

35
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:17,124
Taking his age as consideration,
surgery is ruled out.

36
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,624
To be very honest,
he has got very little time.

37
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,958
Let’s hope for the best.

38
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:24,874
Doctor…

39
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,249
does he have any relatives?

40
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:28,916
Yeah!

41
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:30,458
His son is there.

42
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,916
Vijayendra Ingalgi.

43
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:33,791
Hi!

44
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:35,666
I'm Deepa Hegde.

45
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:38,541
I am sorry about your father.

46
00:03:39,513 --> 00:03:40,916
I hope he recovers soon.

47
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,177
He was a good man.

48
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:47,458
How do you know my father?

49
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,458
Your father has authored a book.

50
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,541
We interviewed him yesterday.

51
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,083
He narrated half the story.

52
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,291
Today he was supposed to finish the story.

53
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:56,916
But…

54
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:57,874
I guess…

55
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,374
it will remain unfinished.

56
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:10,124
I'm not sure if he was a good man or not.

57
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,249
But I'm sure he was not a good father

58
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,624
nor a great husband.

59
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,124
As a child, I don’t remember
him playing with me.

60
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,999
He never checked my marks-cards.

61
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:23,377
He had no idea when I started smoking.
Not that I cared!

62
00:04:23,924 --> 00:04:26,541
He didn’t shed a tear when my mother died.

63
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:29,291
In fact, he never noticed me leaving home.

64
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,249
I am seeing him after 25 years.

65
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,541
But all that mattered to him

66
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:39,374
was that story.

67
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,791
The story of KGF!

68
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:43,791
The story of Rocky!

69
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,374
Don’t know if that is a fact or fiction.

70
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,124
But he lived for that story and..

71
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,916
it cannot go unfinished!

72
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:55,208
That means…

73
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,666
the remaining story

74
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,458
are you going to narrate?

75
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:02,874
He will only narrate.

76
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,291
Go straight, you will find
a Hanuman temple.

77
00:05:17,374 --> 00:05:18,916
4kms ahead from there

78
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,124
you will find that exact place.

79
00:05:20,124 --> 00:05:22,458
The military had a base there
until four years back.

80
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,124
No trespassing was allowed.

81
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:25,674
Why are you venturing into that place Sir?

82
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,458
There is only dust and mud here.

83
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,458
An empire here?

84
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,791
-Hey come on--
-Hey Mason

85
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:33,833
Uh?

86
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,999
Do you see that wild date palm tree?
Dig 35 feet around it.

87
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,333
Hmm…Hmm

88
00:05:38,874 --> 00:05:40,166
What are you looking for Sir?

89
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:43,458
I too have no idea.

90
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,999
Anand Sir prohibited us to even
clean the library.

91
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,208
Besides them, you are the first person
to set foot inside.

92
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:52,999
Be careful Sir!

93
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,201
That's enough! Open.

94
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,416
Hello!
Hey, work is going on. I cannot come now.

95
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,458
Lots to do! Will be there in the morning.

96
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:21,416
Hey hurry, get that JCB here.

97
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:22,541
Brother…

98
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,249
it seems to be a huge boulder.

99
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,583
Hey, get the rope and the chain quickly.

100
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:28,999
OK, I will call you later.

101
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,723
There must be another copy
of the book somewhere.

102
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:32,791
Search for it!

103
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:36,874
Hey just lower it further.

104
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:37,958
Tie the rope!

105
00:06:40,874 --> 00:06:43,791
OK get back. Move away! Move!

106
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:50,958
You still don’t believe all this
could be true?

107
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,124
It could be the work of a mad man!

108
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,416
Lots of journalistic material
and photographs here.

109
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,083
But I am sure

110
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,041
how much ever you search

111
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,624
you'll not find a single photograph
of my mother.

112
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:04,958
Not that I care!

113
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:11,874
And you know what?

114
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:14,543
I don't think you are concerned either.

115
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,458
Right…let it down slowly.

116
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,249
Story seems interesting.

117
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,583
That's why you are here.

118
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:24,708
Right?

119
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:25,749
Hmm!

120
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,416
Were you looking for this Sir?
What is this Sir?

121
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:29,291
Untie the rope.

122
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,183
Let's find out.

123
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:31,791
Eh?

124
00:07:32,874 --> 00:07:34,749
A democratic nation

125
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:36,958
amidst 700 million people

126
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,816
such a vast empire

127
00:07:39,073 --> 00:07:40,706
such a robust system. How?

128
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:42,499
I am not only concerned
how it was made possible…

129
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:50,019
but also curious about who won there.

130
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,249
Wars are waged for the sake of victory.

131
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,291
Victories are achieved to create history.

132
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,374
History always wins.

133
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:31,291
And somewhere hidden in those
pages of history…

134
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,083
Sir! Sir!

135
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:40,416
is the biggest kept secret
in the history of India!

136
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,541
EL…

137
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,374
…DORADO!

138
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:31,249
Sir…

139
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:32,166
Sir excuse me.

140
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:32,541
Sir!

141
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,333
The article that I submitted yesterday

142
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,833
the place under the survey number

143
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:37,291
that I had mentioned as missing

144
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:38,374
It's not published?

145
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,644
I’ve been printing news in this
press for many years.

146
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:43,661
But

147
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:45,542
I don’t want to be the NEWS myself.

148
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:48,583
This matter is no secret.

149
00:09:49,124 --> 00:09:50,999
The interest that my father had in this

150
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,458
the CBI Special Wing

151
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:54,666
had the same amount of interest.

152
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,583
The west coast disturbances,

153
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,749
irregularities in the Bombay refineries,

154
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,666
excessive flow of gold
in the black market…

155
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,833
distribution trails and
hundreds of witnesses.

156
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:04,958
All fingers are pointing
towards one direction Sir!

157
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:05,916
KGF!

158
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:06,791
But…

159
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,541
not even a single charge sheet
filed yet, Sir?

160
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:10,916
Which batch are you Ramesh?

161
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,124
Sir…

162
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:13,541
'74 Sir!

163
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,333
I'm '54!

164
00:10:17,247 --> 00:10:20,541
The effort to excavate the gold
from the mines in KGF is huge.

165
00:10:20,716 --> 00:10:24,916
The effort to reveal the truth about KGF
by the CBI is as enormous.

166
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:27,249
But those documents
will remain in the locker

167
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,249
and nobody will do anything about it.

168
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:32,572
You see that clock?

169
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:35,249
It’s stuck for days.

170
00:10:36,455 --> 00:10:38,458
They are least bothered to repair it.

171
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:42,067
And about this matter

172
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:44,999
you think they will bother?

173
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:47,458
KGF was a well-oiled machine.

174
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:50,087
Everybody knew that the cat
stealthily drank the milk.

175
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,583
But no one had the courage
to bell the cat.

176
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,208
What happened in KGF after Garuda's death?

177
00:10:58,307 --> 00:10:58,958
Will you read it?

178
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,999
Apart from the death of Garuda in KGF,
the outside world knew nothing.

179
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,542
But on the next day, in Pali, where
major decisions are taken…

180
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:12,458
Rajendra Desai, Gurupandian,
Andrews and Kamal

181
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,791
gathered for Garuda’s brother

182
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,198
Virat's coronation.

183
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,124
-Boss!
-Boss!

184
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,801
Is Garuda no more?

185
00:11:27,581 --> 00:11:29,701
Not sure if Garuda’s pyre is lit or not

186
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:31,701
Virat is already showing his true colors.

187
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,029
He has planned his own grand entry.

188
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:36,083
This is very unlike Virat.

189
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,499
The more careless Virat is

190
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,416
the easier it is for us.

191
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:41,708
What about Gurupandian?

192
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,724
We have downed a mammoth

193
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:45,416
crushing a sheep is no big deal.

194
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,131
Don’t you worry!

195
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,635
To aspire to set foot and rule Narachi

196
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,708
is impossible!

197
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,708
Where did Virat..

198
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:35,862
get this temerity from?

199
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:37,917
I will…

200
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:39,465
kill him myself!

201
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:41,083
Uh!

202
00:12:42,124 --> 00:12:42,791
Ah!

203
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:44,994
That Bombay guy

204
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,561
what's his name?

205
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:47,666
Hmm…

206
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:48,600
Rocky!

207
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:49,708
Aah!

208
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,791
Isn't he already killed?

209
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:52,499
Huh!

210
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,606
I missed the chance!

211
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,458
He was sent to KGF to kill Garuda.

212
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:32,541
But he went there to rule KGF.

213
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:35,666
For that, he had to kill Garuda first
and escape the guards.

214
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,458
Most importantly, had to gain
the trust of the people.

215
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:45,291
He created a short circuit
and crossed the white line.

216
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,583
Primarily, he went there to kill Virat.

217
00:13:50,377 --> 00:13:52,541
Disguised as one of the three inmates

218
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:54,458
he slayed Garuda in everyone’s presence.

219
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,073
When Vanaram’s guards stood with the guns

220
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:01,264
the oppressed slaves

221
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:03,835
inspired by Rocky’s feat

222
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,907
trounced the guards and surged ahead!

223
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:09,502
The people

224
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,556
accepted Rocky

225
00:14:10,581 --> 00:14:12,331
as their Emperor!

226
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:16,749
Don't touch me!

227
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:19,708
Reena!

228
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:21,124
What are you doing here?

229
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:22,724
Was at a restaurant with friends.

230
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:24,083
They have forcefully brought me here.

231
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:25,954
Who is that?

232
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:07,708
Dear Lord!

233
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:10,267
Let no more lives be lost for
the sake of this throne!

234
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:14,708
Hmm!

235
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:18,353
That's Rocky…

236
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,833
the one who killed Garuda!

237
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:20,897
It's him!

238
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,041
Eh!

239
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,374
Please sit down.

240
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,108
It’s enough if you have respect and fear
within you.

241
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:29,666
All are ONE!

242
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:34,650
Virat?

243
00:15:35,874 --> 00:15:37,978
Viraaat….Virat!

244
00:15:39,353 --> 00:15:40,041
Finished him off!

245
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:44,624
Tch!

246
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:45,583
Pity!

247
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,958
Gone too soon!

248
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:49,999
Hmm…

249
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,083
You have established a fantastic
council here.

250
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,407
Hey, why are you all so gloomy?

251
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:57,340
Don’t worry, you are in safe hands.

252
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,416
Am new to the place

253
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,833
but not new to the field.

254
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:02,874
I will ensure that your company
progresses.

255
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:06,583
Need your cooperation, support
and blessings…that's enough!

256
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:07,624
Hey!

257
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,517
Do you think its a game of Kho-Kho
to switch positions at will?

258
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:14,416
To safeguard and continue our rich family
legacy built over generations

259
00:16:15,306 --> 00:16:16,580
is why we are all born!

260
00:16:17,064 --> 00:16:19,999
Won’t let an outsider like you
to take control.

261
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,158
Nepotism!

262
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,499
What has happened to our country?

263
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:31,291
Rampant recommendation, donation,
domination, influence, bribe…

264
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:32,820
What should the poor kids do?

265
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:38,124
Is there no place for toppers, non-corrupt
and the hard-working people?

266
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:40,583
What should the person do, who
single-handedly chopped the head off!

267
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,336
MERIT!

268
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:45,594
Am here only on merit!

269
00:16:45,953 --> 00:16:47,624
I deserve some respect.

270
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,791
Your parents have stashed enormous wealth.

271
00:16:51,061 --> 00:16:52,624
But they made a mistake!

272
00:16:53,702 --> 00:16:56,599
They gave birth to you in my lifetime.

273
00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:57,958
I shall keep on ruling

274
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:59,624
and you watch me rule!

275
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:01,239
What do you say darling?

276
00:17:01,501 --> 00:17:02,168
Am I right?

277
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:04,124
Why have you brought me here?

278
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,352
Tell me that first!

279
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,708
To keep you…

280
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,333
In KGF…

281
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,083
for safety my dear.

282
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:16,416
These are dangerous people.

283
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:18,999
Not just that

284
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:22,421
being the head of such a big Company

285
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:24,436
don't I need some company?

286
00:17:26,918 --> 00:17:27,876
Entertainment!

287
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,583
You are my entertainment, my dear!

288
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,041
Hey, stop this!

289
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,208
You seem to have a big ego!

290
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:36,599
I have been watching you.

291
00:17:36,624 --> 00:17:38,069
You are talking nonsense!

292
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,141
How dare you insult my girl
in my presence!

293
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:43,212
-Kamal, what are you doing? Sit down.--
-Is she your entertainment?

294
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,916
-You are crossing the limits.--
-What are you doing? Sit down.

295
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,624
Hey! Do you know your worth?

296
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,333
Living off the pittance you earned
as a shoe polisher in Mumbai slums.

297
00:17:50,374 --> 00:17:52,032
That! That is your true worth!

298
00:17:52,374 --> 00:17:55,676
He's ruling over us today because you
stopped me that day.

299
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,467
Kamal!

300
00:17:57,749 --> 00:17:58,666
Don’t touch me!

301
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,965
People must be shown their right place.

302
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,833
You have now let a stray dog
occupy the throne.

303
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:04,374
Ah?

304
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,749
Ah..he escaped the other day
but not today, no chance!

305
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,749
He is my prey and I am going to kill him.
Ahhh!

306
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:12,739
Aaah!

307
00:18:25,602 --> 00:18:26,708
Where was I?

308
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,208
Entertainment, haha!

309
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:31,368
You’re my entertainment, my love!

310
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,458
C'mon dear! Let's go!

311
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,791
Hey, don’t touch her!

312
00:18:37,595 --> 00:18:38,428
Hey Hey

313
00:18:38,782 --> 00:18:39,375
Hey What!

314
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:41,118
They are all partners.

315
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,071
If none of them survive
how will I get the business done?

316
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,333
We created a ‘Rocky’ to kill Garuda.

317
00:18:57,744 --> 00:19:01,166
Is it so difficult for us to create
another ‘Rocky’ to kill you?

318
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,728
Even my father was not able to

319
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:08,874
it’s impossible for anyone to create
another ROCKY.

320
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:12,158
One and Only piece!

321
00:19:24,803 --> 00:19:28,553
You reared a snake to chase
the rats out of the house.

322
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,064
That too a King Cobra!

323
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,291
Now it’s your turn to move out.

324
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,124
Hope you have made other arrangements!

325
00:19:52,463 --> 00:19:54,041
Hey Farman! What are you upto?

326
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:55,416
Why are you holding the gun?

327
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:57,208
Throw it aside and come down.

328
00:19:57,499 --> 00:19:57,958
Come!

329
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:01,624
Your father sacrificed his life
to save you both.

330
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,267
Imagine your mother’s fate
if something was to befall you.

331
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,377
Hmm!

332
00:20:06,611 --> 00:20:07,194
Ahh!

333
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:10,361
What did you eat today Boranna?

334
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,416
-Radish curry…prepared by Basappa.
-Ha!

335
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:16,833
Four days back?

336
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,208
He provided us with clothes.

337
00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:23,458
He's building homes for us.

338
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:25,833
Got us medicines…

339
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,874
and helped us live respectfully.

340
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,791
Don’t forget all his help

341
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:36,945
now and in the past.

342
00:20:37,874 --> 00:20:39,833
He freed us from bondage.

343
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,031
For him…

344
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,833
I am ready to sacrifice my life.

345
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,833
Hey! Come here for a minute.

346
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:53,849
I knew it

347
00:20:54,257 --> 00:20:57,046
I am the best looking amongst all of us.

348
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,002
I am wearing this after ten years.

349
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:05,434
If God has to safeguard us,
they say we have to pray.

350
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,766
But even to offer prayers

351
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,124
he had to save us!

352
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,458
Uhh!

353
00:21:16,593 --> 00:21:18,708
One who strikes with the hammer!

354
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:38,506
He will be here.

355
00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:40,507
Get dressed as soon as possible.

356
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:41,522
He'd like to…

357
00:21:41,687 --> 00:21:43,562
see you in this attire.

358
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:46,416
Juice is ready.

359
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,291
Do you need anything else sister?

360
00:22:07,095 --> 00:22:08,012
Don't brother!

361
00:22:08,406 --> 00:22:10,291
She will kill you for sure.

362
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:11,874
Ahh!

363
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,002
Why?

364
00:22:42,088 --> 00:22:44,015
I am already deathed dear.

365
00:22:45,223 --> 00:22:48,218
Our tradition is to light a lamp to
welcome home the girl for the first time.

366
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,333
But here you are celebrating
the festival of lights.

367
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:53,166
Drat!

368
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:58,416
I did want to showoff the richness.
But these guys have gone overboard.

369
00:23:01,242 --> 00:23:03,078
Finish the juice once your anger subsides.

370
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:04,749
Get energized

371
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:05,416
Umm!

372
00:23:05,687 --> 00:23:07,458
I shall then take you out for a hunt.

373
00:23:11,461 --> 00:23:13,874
This is the most comfortable room here.

374
00:23:14,556 --> 00:23:15,973
it will be nice if you are around.

375
00:23:16,468 --> 00:23:19,164
Don't get scared and rush into my room!

376
00:23:19,554 --> 00:23:22,874
The moment an unmarried couple
is seen together

377
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,124
the tongues start wagging.

378
00:23:25,328 --> 00:23:26,125
Its hurts!

379
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:27,630
Its hurts!

380
00:23:35,007 --> 00:23:37,234
We have stationed 500 men with guns all.

381
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,208
But they don’t even know to hold them.

382
00:23:39,562 --> 00:23:40,583
How will they use them?

383
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:42,541
They will learn.

384
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,458
Everything!

385
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,291
Eh… Hey!

386
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,124
Why have you still spared him?

387
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,708
He should have been eliminated

388
00:24:06,095 --> 00:24:07,906
much earlier!

389
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,492
Will you kill your commander-in-chief?

390
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:14,906
The moment you free me from these chains

391
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:18,916
I’ll kill you with my bare hands!

392
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:26,705
Are you offended because I killed Garuda?

393
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:31,958
In the game of Chess

394
00:24:32,343 --> 00:24:33,291
when the Soldiers

395
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,499
Knights

396
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,333
Bishops

397
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,374
Rooks

398
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:39,083
and finally the Queen are eliminated
AND the King is checkmated…

399
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:41,570
the Game is over!

400
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,166
Rearrange the pawns…

401
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,333
a new Game begins!

402
00:24:47,874 --> 00:24:50,333
The same rules, the same board. But…

403
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:52,749
a new King!

404
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,554
People are not permanent here

405
00:24:55,968 --> 00:24:57,492
only positions are!

406
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,874
You’ve been around since the inception
of this place

407
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:05,333
guarding and protecting these walls!

408
00:25:05,812 --> 00:25:07,708
The right moves are important for me

409
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,101
while you value the boundaries more.

410
00:25:10,461 --> 00:25:14,041
I am sure that you will not tolerate
the destruction of this place.

411
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:16,458
My next move now will create…

412
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:19,719
a major havoc!

413
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:29,249
When I went to the maintenance room
to check the map, I noticed something.

414
00:25:29,624 --> 00:25:30,999
I couldn’t understand at first

415
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:33,957
but now it all makes sense.

416
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:37,828
I know why you refer to

417
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,916
this existing Mine as
Sector three by nine!

418
00:25:48,695 --> 00:25:50,458
Hey Farmaan!

419
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,242
-Where are you going?
-Rocky boss is calling. I'll be back soon.

420
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,083
FARMAAN!

421
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:56,999
Ah Brother!

422
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:58,499
Greetings brother!

423
00:26:06,874 --> 00:26:08,000
Where are they shooting?

424
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,499
Get him here!

425
00:26:18,124 --> 00:26:19,499
Vanaram is still alive!

426
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,458
Unlock the chains!

427
00:26:37,874 --> 00:26:38,791
Give him a gun!

428
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:39,416
Ahh!

429
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:57,749
Right from holding the gun to
pulling the trigger…

430
00:26:58,017 --> 00:26:59,184
keep observing him.

431
00:27:38,665 --> 00:27:40,367
I will guard again

432
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:42,976
but only on my terms.

433
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:46,641
Before guarding the main gateway

434
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,291
there is a significant barrier.

435
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,781
There is a check post.

436
00:27:53,124 --> 00:27:55,541
Three hundred guards must be posted
there immediately!

437
00:27:58,324 --> 00:28:00,074
Trained 300 guards!

438
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:01,916
Rocky is building an army

439
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:03,583
and has retained Vanaram.

440
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,749
He is planning something big.

441
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:08,749
And all of it seem related to
Sector three by nine.

442
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:11,499
There is so much mystery around it,
isn’t it?

443
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,124
Don’t dramatize it so much

444
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:14,999
after all its fiction, right?

445
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:18,624
I have known Anand
long before you were born.

446
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:21,735
In fact, I know your father
more than I know you.

447
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:23,499
Don’t question his integrity.

448
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,041
Anand…

449
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:26,364
doesn’t have much time left.

450
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:27,666
Please…

451
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:29,993
continue.

452
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:40,124
If he has retained you then

453
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:42,416
it must be for a big festival!

454
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:51,939
Why have you summoned us all here?

455
00:28:52,577 --> 00:28:53,911
Sector three by nine.

456
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,999
was an existing operational Mine.

457
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:59,333
Which was established by Suryavardhan
in 1951.

458
00:29:03,087 --> 00:29:04,079
Why are you all standing here?

459
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:05,791
There is no monster inside.

460
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:12,469
-Come inside.
-Go in if you want, we won’t.

461
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:13,958
It was…

462
00:29:14,173 --> 00:29:15,329
one out of nine.

463
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:17,249
One…

464
00:29:17,977 --> 00:29:18,749
of nine…

465
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:19,916
of what?

466
00:29:21,118 --> 00:29:21,708
It's a lie!

467
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:26,624
And you have been lying for ages.

468
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,583
They say Dream within your limits

469
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:31,583
That's the biggest lie!

470
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:36,938
The rich have always misled the poor.

471
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:39,208
But according to me…

472
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:42,916
greed is good!

473
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:47,041
greed is progress!

474
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:52,166
If there is progress…

475
00:29:54,624 --> 00:29:56,166
One becomes Two…

476
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,499
Two becomes Three…

477
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:06,166
Three becomes Four…

478
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:09,999
Five…

479
00:30:12,499 --> 00:30:13,749
Six…

480
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:16,916
Seven…

481
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:20,833
Eight…

482
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:24,499
Nine!

483
00:30:28,337 --> 00:30:29,212
So…

484
00:30:30,485 --> 00:30:31,333
were there…

485
00:30:31,977 --> 00:30:32,999
nine Mines?

486
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,458
You see, when Suryavardhana started off

487
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:38,868
he had a vision to sustain the empire
for centuries.

488
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:40,874
So, he ensured the other eight Mines were
shrouded in secrecy…

489
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:43,291
to ward off evil intentions.

490
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:44,791
But Rocky…

491
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:49,041
firmly decided to excavate all the gold
in two years.

492
00:30:50,397 --> 00:30:52,231
Why should one dream within limit?

493
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:54,499
Sky is my limit!

494
00:30:57,874 --> 00:31:00,249
Boss, no one is entering the Mines!

495
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,166
Hey partners!

496
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:04,999
No more conspiring.

497
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:06,833
Get ready to work.

498
00:31:07,438 --> 00:31:08,666
Time to progress!

499
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:11,166
Let’s reap a rich harvest!

500
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:18,467
Deepavali!

501
00:31:19,012 --> 00:31:19,470
eh?

502
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:24,290
You enquired about the Big Festival.

503
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:34,124
None of them can hold the ground.

504
00:31:34,594 --> 00:31:37,291
What can he achieve with these cowards?

505
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:39,916
Yes sir!

506
00:31:40,527 --> 00:31:41,790
As you said…

507
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,874
we had no courage

508
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:45,749
no strength

509
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:47,624
no belief.

510
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:50,333
The sword was hanging on our heads!

511
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:56,079
But one man stood in between and
slashed a throat during Maari festival

512
00:31:59,124 --> 00:32:01,958
That day, after several years

513
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:04,083
we celebrated death!

514
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:08,374
This fierce Hurricane!

515
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:10,180
The vigorous swipe of his sword

516
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:12,666
created a storm!

517
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:17,291
That storm…

518
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:19,666
got everyone in Narachi

519
00:32:19,749 --> 00:32:21,583
a new lease of life.

520
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:23,749
I have a suggestion.

521
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:25,208
Please beware

522
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:28,041
don’t go against him sir…

523
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,749
Move out of the way!

524
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:33,374
This braveheart throws a challenge!

525
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:37,374
He is the piercing arc of the lightning!

526
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:41,583
This braveheart throws a challenge!

527
00:32:41,624 --> 00:32:46,249
He is the piercing arc of the lightning!

528
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:15,666
-Hey I am Rocky, I am Rocky!
-I resemble him more than anyone!

529
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:19,874
Hey…what’s this?
Always chanting Rocky Rocky Rocky!

530
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:20,916
Get lost from here!

531
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,499
Oh! a new entrant.

532
00:33:26,057 --> 00:33:26,874
She is totally ignorant.

533
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:28,416
Come!

534
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:32,208
Come…Come!

535
00:33:35,499 --> 00:33:40,208
Do you know why we always chant
Rocky’s name?

536
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:41,291
Watch now!

537
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:44,791
Hey look here he comes. Rocky! Rocky!

538
00:33:49,815 --> 00:33:50,624
Shall I tell you now…

539
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,083
why they are all bowing to him?

540
00:33:57,583 --> 00:34:01,708
from the ocean belly!

541
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:13,916
Is silently murmuring

542
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:17,958
By his piercing glare!

543
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:41,583
To dampen the forest fire

544
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:03,583
This braveheart throws a challenge!

545
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:07,666
He is the piercing arc of the lightning!

546
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:11,458
This braveheart throws a challenge!

547
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:16,166
He is the piercing arc of the lightning!

548
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:39,166
Fire!

549
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:41,208
Fire!

550
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:55,166
We have a request.

551
00:35:55,701 --> 00:35:56,285
Mother!

552
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:57,522
Please come.

553
00:36:04,543 --> 00:36:07,126
She is the first girl child
who has survived here.

554
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,665
Please choose a name for her.

555
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:16,541
Shanthi!

556
00:36:23,374 --> 00:36:23,958
Mother!

557
00:36:42,098 --> 00:36:42,806
It's time.

558
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:43,479
I will take leave.

559
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:16,333
Rocky is sending the raw material to Varca
for extraction.

560
00:37:17,007 --> 00:37:18,299
If we don’t stop him now…

561
00:37:18,912 --> 00:37:20,479
the extracted gold will be his

562
00:37:20,996 --> 00:37:22,273
and the leftover scrap

563
00:37:22,522 --> 00:37:23,054
will be ours.

564
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:26,999
The old game is over.

565
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:29,333
They have rearranged the pawns

566
00:37:29,928 --> 00:37:31,387
and have started a new game.

567
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:36,749
Take it from the top
so that everyone knows.

568
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:39,083
Till date, no one is aware
of the happenings in KGF.

569
00:37:39,374 --> 00:37:41,249
Who is controlling it is also a mystery!

570
00:37:41,672 --> 00:37:42,836
But according to my sources

571
00:37:43,068 --> 00:37:44,610
there has been entirely new leadership.

572
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:46,499
They all have been assassinated sir.

573
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:48,208
Aye! Aye!

574
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,708
How long do we live in fear?

575
00:37:50,874 --> 00:37:51,791
What are you saying?

576
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:54,208
Even though we are Central Ministers,
our hands are tied!

577
00:37:54,374 --> 00:37:56,249
We are dancing to Gurupandian’s tunes.

578
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:57,499
Suryavardhan is dead

579
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:58,541
and so is Garuda!

580
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,624
And now it seems a new master
has taken over.

581
00:38:00,874 --> 00:38:03,124
Somebody else from this organization
is controlling it?

582
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:03,624
No Sir!

583
00:38:04,124 --> 00:38:05,541
It seems an outsider

584
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,208
has forcefully taken control.

585
00:38:07,624 --> 00:38:07,999
What?

586
00:38:08,249 --> 00:38:10,041
We were more worried about the strength…

587
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:12,499
of the rock we had planned to crush.

588
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:14,100
How is this even possible?

589
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:17,999
Now we realize that the hammer was
far more threatening than the rock!

590
00:38:18,281 --> 00:38:20,156
Amidst these powerful people…

591
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:21,092
one more?

592
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:22,624
Hey, out with it!

593
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,499
Shetty sir, a new boss has taken over KGF.

594
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:26,395
Who?

595
00:38:26,842 --> 00:38:27,748
ROCKY!

596
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:33,333
He had an eye on your coveted throne
since his childhood.

597
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:34,958
He’ll arrive this time

598
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:36,791
and occupy the throne.

599
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:39,708
He’s now your boss, as well as mine.

600
00:38:39,928 --> 00:38:41,821
Enough of the oppression of KGF!

601
00:38:42,048 --> 00:38:43,048
Let's put an end to it now.

602
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:44,649
How?

603
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,303
If Gurupandian and his government falls

604
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:49,083
she will emerge right?

605
00:38:53,627 --> 00:38:54,710
She will put an end to it.

606
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,208
We have to now get the commitment
from other MPs.

607
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:03,541
Inayath Khalil’s number is in
the table drawer, Shetty Bhai.

608
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:08,124
Rest is upto you.

609
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:12,282
How do we destroy that hammer now…

610
00:39:13,704 --> 00:39:14,958
think about it!

611
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:19,416
-Ah! Boss!
-Boss!

612
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,583
Find out if this is true!

613
00:39:30,124 --> 00:39:31,124
Otherwise…

614
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:33,416
find out about this…

615
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:35,083
outsider.

616
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:43,208
Is this all?

617
00:39:44,774 --> 00:39:45,765
Does not suffice!

618
00:39:45,923 --> 00:39:47,087
Work harder!

619
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:49,462
Mining should continue day and night.

620
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:12,249
These walls have witnessed
a lot of bloodshed.

621
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,916
The reason for that is this sword!

622
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:17,666
Adheera's sword!

623
00:40:27,374 --> 00:40:31,874
Do you know why people are so scared
to see the sword of a dead man?

624
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:38,041
Adheera in his childhood was
influenced by the Vikings clan

625
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:40,666
adopted their ruthless tactics

626
00:40:40,874 --> 00:40:42,249
and became the epitome of cruelty.

627
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:45,791
He ensured that no one dared
point fingers towards KGF.

628
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:48,791
He forced people to toil in the Mines.

629
00:40:49,124 --> 00:40:50,624
More importantly

630
00:40:50,874 --> 00:40:53,624
to fulfill his brother's wish

631
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:57,458
he created an empire mercilessly
on the might of his sword.

632
00:40:57,874 --> 00:40:59,291
If he was around

633
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:04,416
he would not have let you set foot in KGF.

634
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:12,624
Rocky had taken control of the
most precious piece of land on earth

635
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:14,541
To gain control of that

636
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:16,499
people were ready to kill

637
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,291
ready to be killed

638
00:41:18,624 --> 00:41:19,541
and even…

639
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:22,083
come back from the dead.

640
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:31,541
Aren’t you dead yet?

641
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:34,208
Your urge to kill seems unsatiated.

642
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:36,083
You want more wars

643
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:38,999
to wipe out the world?

644
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:40,166
The swing of a sword

645
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:42,624
and the splash of blood in a battle

646
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:45,624
is not to destroy…

647
00:43:58,374 --> 00:43:59,916
but to progress!

648
00:44:00,912 --> 00:44:03,499
The fallen corpses there are useful too.

649
00:44:03,749 --> 00:44:06,083
If you are in doubt, ask the vultures!

650
00:44:09,624 --> 00:44:12,624
Do you think you are invincible?

651
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:18,916
To raise a towering fortress

652
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:22,149
you must first dig deep.

653
00:44:23,493 --> 00:44:27,833
If you explore the depths
of this empire’s foundation,

654
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,458
you will not find stones

655
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:33,374
but the skulls of my adversaries.

656
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:37,499
He will stop you!

657
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:42,749
Our God will stop you!

658
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:46,208
I've heard…

659
00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:50,249
ROCKY!

660
00:44:51,624 --> 00:44:54,249
I will crush him.

661
00:44:58,124 --> 00:45:00,958
A puny person like me

662
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:03,958
single-handedly managed to block your army

663
00:45:04,249 --> 00:45:06,708
and send shivers down your spine.

664
00:45:08,374 --> 00:45:10,874
Imagine to what extent he could go.

665
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:23,083
It's a waste of time
to focus on small fries.

666
00:45:24,499 --> 00:45:26,749
Eliminate the big fish!

667
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:31,958
After all, your God…

668
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:34,874
is also made of flesh and blood.

669
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:43,124
What’s so urgent?

670
00:45:43,749 --> 00:45:45,374
You asked me to come alone.

671
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:47,041
Rocky can be eliminated.

672
00:45:48,166 --> 00:45:50,249
For that, we need him out of there first.

673
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,291
How to get him out?

674
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,499
If we get Reena out…he'll follow.

675
00:45:55,749 --> 00:45:56,833
How’s that possible?

676
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:59,541
If there are rumors about your well-being?

677
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:02,374
Nobody will believe that.

678
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:04,416
If it is on TV…

679
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:07,666
won't they believe?

680
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:14,624
Last night on the outskirts of Bangalore

681
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:18,374
industrialist Rajendra Desai
was shot dead.

682
00:46:18,374 --> 00:46:21,583
There seems a link between this murder and
disappearance of industrialist Kamal

683
00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:25,249
and it appears that there is a
big conspiracy behind this.

684
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:47,874
Let's go!

685
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:35,124
Rocky has been brought out!

686
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:50,999
Where are they leading him to?

687
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:16,958
He is coming!

688
00:49:57,374 --> 00:49:59,166
We never thought he’d reach KGF.

689
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:01,041
Killing Garuda there seemed impossible.

690
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:04,166
Never imagined that he would control KGF.

691
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:12,708
He’s a shrewd player.

692
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:32,166
We can't be certain that he will not
wrestle his way out of this web.

693
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:36,708
Hey!

694
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:39,291
Aah!

695
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:48,166
A fish assumes that the worm is its prey.

696
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:01,624
Only when it bites, it realises

697
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:03,416
it is a bait!

698
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:17,916
And this time we know
who is holding the bait.

699
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:30,583
It's impossible to escape.

700
00:53:24,374 --> 00:53:25,416
The God…

701
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:28,291
is on his knees.

702
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:35,124
Did you miss reading the board?

703
00:53:36,874 --> 00:53:40,291
I’ve come a long way,
severed several heads…

704
00:53:41,499 --> 00:53:43,124
to build KGF!

705
00:53:43,541 --> 00:53:45,624
You are just a novice!

706
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:49,041
Just by trouncing a handful of people,
do you think that…

707
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:51,291
you elevated yourself?

708
00:53:54,041 --> 00:53:56,624
This is not a game of just ladders…

709
00:53:57,541 --> 00:53:58,874
but also snakes!

710
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:01,583
There is this one deadly snake

711
00:54:02,166 --> 00:54:03,958
and if it bites

712
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:07,874
you’ll reach the nadir!

713
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:12,333
Go!

714
00:54:13,624 --> 00:54:15,124
I'm sparing you.

715
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:19,541
I wont take your life today.

716
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:26,749
Because, I want you to go to your people.

717
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:33,624
They have a lot of faith in you.

718
00:54:38,124 --> 00:54:40,624
They have to see you in this state.

719
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:46,791
They have to see your blood

720
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:54,124
Break their faith!

721
00:55:00,041 --> 00:55:02,291
Hey…who did this?

722
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:08,833
Adhee…Adheera is still alive!

723
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:18,416
That bridge

724
00:55:18,624 --> 00:55:20,041
all those who went there

725
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:21,458
Adheera killed them!

726
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,208
Proclaim to them.

727
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:43,208
I am coming!

728
00:55:49,208 --> 00:55:50,583
To reclaim my sword…

729
00:55:51,499 --> 00:55:53,458
and my KGF!

730
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:56,458
The head is chopped off.

731
00:55:57,083 --> 00:56:00,166
How long will the body sustain?

732
00:56:01,749 --> 00:56:02,499
Is everyone here?

733
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:11,333
In 25 years, there were many
no-confidence motions against Gurupandian.

734
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:13,124
But until now

735
00:56:13,624 --> 00:56:14,999
no one had raised hands.

736
00:56:15,624 --> 00:56:18,166
Today a proposal by the opposition party

737
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,708
has been put forth for a
no-confidence motion.

738
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:23,208
Whoever intends to vote

739
00:56:23,249 --> 00:56:24,624
please raise your hands.

740
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,666
Stop the trucks leaving for Varca!

741
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:31,499
Trucks have already left for Varca sir!

742
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:40,958
Shetty, for the first time

743
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:44,541
had gathered all Rocky’s supporters
for a feast.

744
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,624
Breaking news!

745
00:57:08,624 --> 00:57:11,624
Result of the No Confidence Motion
from the parliament.

746
00:57:11,624 --> 00:57:14,749
It is against Gurupandian’s DYSS party.

747
00:57:14,916 --> 00:57:18,208
This may pave the way for
the next general election.

748
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:20,249
Is the job done?

749
00:57:22,249 --> 00:57:25,624
Kochi, Mangalore, Kasipur, Surat and Murad

750
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:29,249
all of Rocky’s stooges here
have been killed Shetty Bhai!

751
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:33,458
The West Coast is all yours now!

752
00:57:42,874 --> 00:57:45,958
A vote for no confidence motion
will be held at a further date.

753
00:57:53,707 --> 00:57:55,207
Hey, the truck is coming!

754
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:56,541
Adheera had sent a message that

755
00:57:56,916 --> 00:57:59,749
no one should set foot outside KGF.

756
00:58:13,499 --> 00:58:15,541
Brother! Rescue us!

757
00:58:15,624 --> 00:58:17,791
Send men to the West Wall immediately!

758
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:19,583
Spruce up the security here!

759
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:21,666
None of our people
should step out of here.

760
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:23,583
Shut the main gates!

761
00:58:27,624 --> 00:58:29,208
Didn’t last for long.

762
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:31,708
Everything fell apart!

763
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:38,124
He lost again.

764
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:40,916
Shetty and Inayath Khaleel

765
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:43,041
took control of the west coast.

766
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:45,291
He had no say in Delhi now.

767
00:58:45,624 --> 00:58:47,541
The distributors abandoned him.

768
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:51,333
Adheera cut off all access to KGF.

769
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:53,833
Ration could last for only eight days.

770
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:55,874
There is fear everywhere.

771
00:58:56,541 --> 00:58:57,333
Rocky…

772
00:58:58,458 --> 00:58:59,874
His survival is in doubt.

773
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:16,999
I treat small injuries.

774
00:59:17,374 --> 00:59:18,791
I have tried my best.

775
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:20,749
Beyond that, its left to God.

776
00:59:47,749 --> 00:59:48,374
Why?

777
00:59:52,249 --> 00:59:52,916
What happened?

778
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:56,208
I'm here for you.

779
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:58,583
Don't be scared.

780
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:01,124
Go to sleep.

781
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:04,458
Shh…shh!

782
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:52,124
Hey Rocky Bhai!

783
01:00:52,499 --> 01:00:53,833
So you are the king now?

784
01:00:57,541 --> 01:00:59,416
You were better off here.

785
01:00:59,749 --> 01:01:02,124
Feeding on the leftovers.

786
01:01:02,374 --> 01:01:03,791
Where did you go away?

787
01:01:03,999 --> 01:01:05,458
In search of name and fame.

788
01:01:06,124 --> 01:01:09,041
Now…you will die a dog's death!

789
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,333
But I’ll give you another chance.

790
01:01:11,749 --> 01:01:13,791
Sit next to me on the floor

791
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:16,208
and massage my feet.

792
01:01:16,874 --> 01:01:17,541
Come.

793
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:18,999
Ah!

794
01:01:19,624 --> 01:01:20,374
And listen.

795
01:01:20,874 --> 01:01:24,083
Heard that you have a pretty girlfriend.

796
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:27,791
Bring her along with you!

797
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:29,666
Don't forget!

798
01:01:38,374 --> 01:01:39,749
Isn’t he your friend?

799
01:01:40,666 --> 01:01:42,291
He probably needs entertainment too…

800
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:45,583
Send me away.

801
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:59,749
-Sir…let me see him once--
-Not allowed. Boss is unwell.

802
01:02:00,041 --> 01:02:00,791
Please…

803
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:03,291
Hey…let her in

804
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:11,541
You are more than God to my son sir.

805
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:16,333
You have always been in his thoughts.

806
01:02:17,666 --> 01:02:20,499
You posted him…to guard the bridge.

807
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:26,166
They killed him!

808
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:31,124
Not sure where he is lying dead…my son!

809
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:35,249
Vultures must be devouring him…

810
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:45,833
You want to be king right?

811
01:02:46,624 --> 01:02:47,499
For that…

812
01:02:47,874 --> 01:02:49,458
luck and people’s prayers are needed.

813
01:02:50,374 --> 01:02:53,374
Destiny…is in one’s own hands!

814
01:02:54,458 --> 01:02:56,291
But good wishes are…

815
01:02:57,833 --> 01:02:59,333
showered by other people.

816
01:03:01,666 --> 01:03:03,499
Give me what I want

817
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:06,124
And your wish will be fulfilled.

818
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:10,958
Sir, Sir…just let me see my son once.

819
01:03:10,999 --> 01:03:14,624
For one last time sir.

820
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:20,541
Show me my son one last time…

821
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:35,416
Son…are you alright?

822
01:03:35,666 --> 01:03:36,708
Yes uncle!

823
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:37,791
What’s going on here?

824
01:03:38,124 --> 01:03:39,291
I fail to understand.

825
01:03:39,624 --> 01:03:40,416
Forget it.

826
01:03:41,749 --> 01:03:42,583
Uncle…

827
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:46,791
can you do me…a final favour?

828
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:51,166
Tell me.

829
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:54,166
What is it that you want?

830
01:04:00,833 --> 01:04:02,666
Everything is going out of control.

831
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:05,791
It’s no longer safe here.

832
01:04:08,249 --> 01:04:09,458
Away from all this…

833
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:11,624
let’s go on a vacation.

834
01:04:15,666 --> 01:04:17,291
Get the helicopter ready.

835
01:04:44,874 --> 01:04:47,541
-Where is he off to?--
-Will he return?

836
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:50,333
Heard he’s run away with all the money
in the treasury.

837
01:04:50,374 --> 01:04:53,374
- Why are you deserting us Oh Lord?--

838
01:04:53,499 --> 01:04:54,791
He will not betray us.

839
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:55,541
He is our God!

840
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:58,333
He will never return.

841
01:04:59,249 --> 01:05:00,833
He’s run away with all the wealth.

842
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:04,624
-He has gone.--
-Will he ever come back?

843
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:07,083
He will never betray us!

844
01:05:07,083 --> 01:05:10,249
Not sure where he is lying dead…my son!

845
01:05:10,249 --> 01:05:12,874
Vultures must be devouring him…

846
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:23,833
Show me my son once, sir…

847
01:05:24,124 --> 01:05:27,749
I want to see my son one last time.
Sir..sir!

848
01:05:27,749 --> 01:05:32,083
Show me my son once sir! Sir…

849
01:05:32,416 --> 01:05:34,499
On one end, KGF is sinking.

850
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:37,124
He took all the wealth and

851
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:41,166
-eloped with the girl--
-No sir! What you are saying is incorrect!

852
01:05:41,166 --> 01:05:42,624
Please read out what is written sir.

853
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:44,874
Aye! Go, get back to your work.

854
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:52,958
Is he right?

855
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:58,666
What are you kids doing?

856
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:01,791
Hey!

857
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:05,458
All of you come here.

858
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:08,374
This is not the way a tiger hunts.

859
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:10,208
How else?

860
01:06:17,958 --> 01:06:20,208
Silently in the bush…

861
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:25,166
it hides and waits for its prey.

862
01:06:25,291 --> 01:06:28,041
Once the prey nears

863
01:06:28,624 --> 01:06:31,791
suddenly it pounces and goes
for the jugular.

864
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:37,083
A grip on the neck renders
other parts of body useless.

865
01:06:37,374 --> 01:06:39,708
It gradually suffocates…

866
01:06:48,791 --> 01:06:52,749
Some people find solace in
braving the storm…

867
01:06:53,541 --> 01:06:55,416
You are moving around in disguise.

868
01:06:55,874 --> 01:06:57,583
As you all believe…

869
01:06:57,874 --> 01:06:59,916
Rocky is not absconding.

870
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:02,166
Then…has he gone to kill Shetty?

871
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:06,333
You don’t spare the rowdies
wherever you go…

872
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:10,333
don't think you would spare the rowdies
coming in search of you?

873
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:13,791
If Shetty is killed, another will emerge.

874
01:07:14,249 --> 01:07:15,249
Why are you here?

875
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:18,291
That’s why…

876
01:07:19,833 --> 01:07:22,166
he’s gone to meet Inayath Khaleel!

877
01:07:36,124 --> 01:07:38,458
Boss, they are bringing Rocky to you.

878
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:44,333
Let him in!

879
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:12,749
Salaam…Valikum

880
01:08:13,749 --> 01:08:17,458
Walaikum Assalam
Wa-rehamatullahi wa-barkatahu

881
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:21,708
My country

882
01:08:21,749 --> 01:08:24,041
teaches to respect all religions!

883
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:38,624
In my own city, you booked all the rooms
at my hotel to gain my attention.

884
01:08:38,874 --> 01:08:40,624
I admire your style!

885
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:43,208
You have travelled far…

886
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:44,874
to die!

887
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:47,208
Am here to get you business.

888
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:50,874
Business…what business?

889
01:08:51,458 --> 01:08:55,249
Your gold moves from Africa to Dubai
and from Dubai to India.

890
01:08:56,041 --> 01:08:56,874
Double risk!

891
01:08:57,374 --> 01:08:59,666
I’ll take delivery directly in Africa.

892
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:01,499
Risk is all mine.

893
01:09:02,083 --> 01:09:03,416
Will buy unlimited quantity.

894
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:05,541
Deal?

895
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:08,499
The offer is very good.

896
01:09:09,374 --> 01:09:11,208
But you are late.

897
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:14,416
Would have probably considered
if you had come earlier.

898
01:09:15,249 --> 01:09:17,916
On one side the government has fallen…

899
01:09:18,499 --> 01:09:19,291
What next sir?

900
01:09:19,874 --> 01:09:24,583
Next…Ramika Sen will take oath
as next Prime Minister of India

901
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:26,541
and…

902
01:09:27,166 --> 01:09:28,333
KGF will end.

903
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:30,749
and on the other side…

904
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:34,333
he is moving towards KGF

905
01:09:44,791 --> 01:09:47,291
And you are here like a coward.

906
01:09:47,749 --> 01:09:49,583
You have nothing now!

907
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:52,041
You have lost everything.

908
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:55,541
Atleast you should have made
a couple of friends.

909
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:59,374
I have made friends…all over Hindustan.

910
01:10:18,499 --> 01:10:21,416
What will I answer them?

911
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:26,874
Uncle

912
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:30,041
can you help me with one last task?

913
01:10:33,374 --> 01:10:34,166
Tell me.

914
01:10:35,749 --> 01:10:37,208
What do you want?

915
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:39,208
Which gun is that?

916
01:10:42,499 --> 01:10:47,041
I want the same that I wanted
20 years ago!

917
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:48,416
The WORLD…..

918
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,333
When I decided to take over Bombay

919
01:10:55,374 --> 01:10:58,708
I have dug their graves and built tombs.

920
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:04,083
I have etched their names!

921
01:11:04,374 --> 01:11:05,916
Just mark the dates uncle!

922
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:13,166
The time has come!

923
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:16,916
Give sweets to the kids.

924
01:11:32,041 --> 01:11:34,874
Hey, whom are you stopping?
Remove it. Now!

925
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:42,499
What is it called?

926
01:11:42,624 --> 01:11:43,749
Kalashnikov.

927
01:11:44,083 --> 01:11:45,583
Kalash…

928
01:11:51,458 --> 01:11:53,041
Hey…where are you going?

929
01:13:10,083 --> 01:13:10,749
Boss!

930
01:13:17,499 --> 01:13:20,833
Boss, we have lost the west coast!
Rocky has killed them all!

931
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:26,874
Kalashnikov!

932
01:13:26,874 --> 01:13:29,666
Don’t know about his whereabouts,
but he will attack you next!

933
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,958
This story is written in blood.

934
01:13:48,249 --> 01:13:49,874
It can’t continue with ink.

935
01:13:54,249 --> 01:13:55,541
If it has to continue…

936
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:57,666
it has to be only with blood!

937
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:10,416
I don’t need anyone’s friendship.

938
01:14:11,041 --> 01:14:13,624
No one can endure my enmity!

939
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:15,458
Let’s do business!

940
01:14:16,541 --> 01:14:18,291
Offer closes soon!

941
01:15:16,753 --> 01:15:19,670
He went to Inayath Khalil and
struck a business deal.

942
01:15:20,628 --> 01:15:23,170
And then he took back the west coast?

943
01:15:23,753 --> 01:15:24,586
With style!

944
01:15:24,878 --> 01:15:25,545
Hmm!

945
01:15:30,503 --> 01:15:31,045
Hello.

946
01:15:32,211 --> 01:15:33,003
There was a call.

947
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,378
The trucks…have to be prepared
to leave for Varca.

948
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:04,420
But there…in KGF

949
01:16:04,711 --> 01:16:05,961
Isn't Adheera waiting?

950
01:16:45,003 --> 01:16:46,628
He's back again?

951
01:17:17,753 --> 01:17:18,670
Gun!

952
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:25,211
Rocky went to Dubai for two reasons.

953
01:17:25,586 --> 01:17:26,753
What’s the other reason?

954
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,795
He had gone there with enough money

955
01:17:28,795 --> 01:17:32,670
But wasn’t that an advance for the gold
Inayath Khalil was sending?

956
01:17:33,003 --> 01:17:33,586
No!

957
01:17:34,503 --> 01:17:35,753
Then what was it for?

958
01:17:38,378 --> 01:17:42,711
KALASHNIKOV…

959
01:19:24,878 --> 01:19:28,461
Tch…tch!

960
01:19:30,378 --> 01:19:33,795
Violence…Violence

961
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:35,795
I don't like it.

962
01:19:36,211 --> 01:19:37,086
I avoid…

963
01:19:38,086 --> 01:19:38,711
but

964
01:19:39,795 --> 01:19:42,211
Violence likes me!

965
01:19:43,545 --> 01:19:44,836
I can't avoid.

966
01:19:48,586 --> 01:19:52,836
When two stones rub against each other,
it creates a forest fire.

967
01:19:53,086 --> 01:19:55,836
Similarly in a war between two people…

968
01:19:56,753 --> 01:20:00,128
their followers also perish.

969
01:20:00,836 --> 01:20:01,878
What do you call that?

970
01:20:02,295 --> 01:20:04,045
Collateral damage!

971
01:20:06,003 --> 01:20:06,836
So…

972
01:20:07,628 --> 01:20:10,128
in life, it is important to
befriend the right people

973
01:20:10,128 --> 01:20:12,836
and choose your battles wisely.

974
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:18,378
and most importantly,
to choose your life partner.

975
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,961
You want to choose my girl!

976
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:27,961
I understand what your problem is guys…

977
01:20:28,878 --> 01:20:31,253
Your long years of labour

978
01:20:31,628 --> 01:20:34,128
is brushed aside suddenly by an outsider…

979
01:20:37,336 --> 01:20:38,128
I understand.

980
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,003
What did you say?

981
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,253
The one who just took one step forward?

982
01:20:48,086 --> 01:20:52,128
In a clock, the big hand takes 60 steps
to complete an hour…but the small hand

983
01:20:52,961 --> 01:20:54,503
needs to take just one step!

984
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:58,711
And I have taken that ONE step.
The range of the game has changed.

985
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:00,461
In this game of Snake and Ladders,

986
01:21:01,128 --> 01:21:02,670
Mongoose has entered the fray!

987
01:21:04,211 --> 01:21:05,503
I will let you go.

988
01:21:09,086 --> 01:21:10,711
But remember this…

989
01:21:11,336 --> 01:21:16,461
No more haggling over territories
henceforth.

990
01:21:19,336 --> 01:21:21,461
The world…is

991
01:21:21,753 --> 01:21:23,086
MY territory!

992
01:21:37,753 --> 01:21:39,295
He had such a phenomenal rise that

993
01:21:39,378 --> 01:21:41,753
no one even dared to confront him right?

994
01:21:42,003 --> 01:21:43,503
Gravitational power.

995
01:21:43,711 --> 01:21:45,003
Gravitational power?

996
01:21:45,586 --> 01:21:48,503
Oh yes…gravitational power!

997
01:21:48,836 --> 01:21:51,670
Don't get confused. There are two types.

998
01:21:51,836 --> 01:21:54,753
In Newton's gravity apples fall down.

999
01:21:55,128 --> 01:21:56,711
In Rocky's gravity…

1000
01:21:57,253 --> 01:21:59,128
people go up!

1001
01:22:01,295 --> 01:22:03,003
Hey Anil…what are you doing?

1002
01:22:03,211 --> 01:22:05,336
The no confidence motion will begin now

1003
01:22:05,711 --> 01:22:06,711
by show of hands.

1004
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:09,586
Daya…want a drink?

1005
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:12,003
What happened?

1006
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:16,003
Whoever is healthy…raise you hands.

1007
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:17,628
Hey, he is playing a game.

1008
01:22:17,961 --> 01:22:20,795
The game played by the kids.
Hop skip and jump

1009
01:22:21,211 --> 01:22:22,170
All against.

1010
01:22:23,045 --> 01:22:23,795
Be careful!

1011
01:22:24,295 --> 01:22:27,253
Raising hand without thinking
is injurious to health.

1012
01:22:27,753 --> 01:22:31,211
They first draw the boxes and then
play with stones within them.

1013
01:22:31,378 --> 01:22:32,378
But he…

1014
01:22:33,795 --> 01:22:36,045
throws the stone wherever he wants

1015
01:22:36,295 --> 01:22:38,253
and then draws the box around it.

1016
01:22:38,545 --> 01:22:41,003
The no confidence motion held today

1017
01:22:41,045 --> 01:22:43,628
resulted in unanimously favouring
the ruling party.

1018
01:22:43,836 --> 01:22:46,420
This government will certainly
continue to be in power.

1019
01:22:47,378 --> 01:22:50,461
The fish nowadays, seem to be
swallowing the baiters.

1020
01:22:51,128 --> 01:22:52,795
People holding the bait?

1021
01:23:04,586 --> 01:23:06,753
Don't tear off that big piece.

1022
01:23:07,086 --> 01:23:09,670
If its not removed
the pain will worsen sir.

1023
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:13,378
Let the pain shoot up…that’s what I want!

1024
01:23:13,545 --> 01:23:16,295
This pain reminds me of him everyday.

1025
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,003
Remove the remaining small pieces!

1026
01:24:44,336 --> 01:24:46,461
Between the cries of pain and death…

1027
01:24:48,961 --> 01:24:50,753
silently there stood…

1028
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:53,753
a mountain of hope!

1029
01:24:54,836 --> 01:24:56,753
By the Law of the Cosmos

1030
01:24:58,128 --> 01:24:59,795
the Decree of the Lord

1031
01:25:00,336 --> 01:25:02,336
and the prayers of a mother

1032
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:12,836
every line on your palm
is in agreement that

1033
01:25:14,253 --> 01:25:16,795
the unstoppable juggernaut is

1034
01:25:17,795 --> 01:25:20,128
your Empire!

1035
01:25:20,961 --> 01:25:24,503
He stood, this Wild Warrior!

1036
01:25:24,503 --> 01:25:28,378
With throbbing nerves we stand!

1037
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:32,253
This Wild Warrior!

1038
01:25:32,295 --> 01:25:36,211
With our heads held high!

1039
01:25:36,211 --> 01:25:39,670
To burn the conflict!

1040
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:43,753
Like a hurricane!

1041
01:25:43,795 --> 01:25:47,711
Soothed by you, you Valorous!

1042
01:25:47,753 --> 01:25:51,753
Now stand with courage, gallant Fighter!

1043
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:57,253
The divine Emperor!

1044
01:25:57,295 --> 01:26:01,170
This daring Emperor!

1045
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:05,003
The divine Emperor!

1046
01:26:05,045 --> 01:26:09,045
This daring Emperor!

1047
01:26:26,253 --> 01:26:27,545
-Hey Pathan!
-Yes Boss

1048
01:26:28,045 --> 01:26:29,295
Did you missing me?

1049
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:31,211
Yes Boss.

1050
01:26:31,795 --> 01:26:32,878
Shetty is gone.

1051
01:26:36,670 --> 01:26:37,461
Hey Rocky!

1052
01:26:38,003 --> 01:26:39,295
How are you my son?

1053
01:26:43,086 --> 01:26:44,670
Hey, please don't hurt me!

1054
01:26:45,086 --> 01:26:46,128
Don't do anything to me.

1055
01:26:46,378 --> 01:26:47,711
Please don't…

1056
01:26:54,711 --> 01:26:56,336
Khasim…

1057
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:58,086
Khasim brother…

1058
01:26:58,253 --> 01:26:59,795
At least you tell him

1059
01:26:59,795 --> 01:27:01,961
Tell him not to hurt me Khasim!

1060
01:27:02,211 --> 01:27:03,795
Please tell him…

1061
01:27:09,545 --> 01:27:12,586
Hey…hey! Sit on this throne!

1062
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:16,711
Rule this Bombay!
This ocean and everything…is yours!

1063
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:21,795
Rocky my son! I will dust it for you.
You sit…sit here.

1064
01:27:25,211 --> 01:27:25,961
Please sit.

1065
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:29,295
Sit.

1066
01:27:41,086 --> 01:27:44,128
Rocky…please let me go Rocky.

1067
01:27:44,670 --> 01:27:46,211
Please forgive me.

1068
01:27:46,378 --> 01:27:47,670
Rocky please let me go.

1069
01:27:47,961 --> 01:27:49,503
I will set you free.

1070
01:27:50,670 --> 01:27:54,211
But you commented about my sweetheart!

1071
01:27:55,045 --> 01:27:57,378
So, you should have killed me then!

1072
01:27:57,961 --> 01:28:00,003
I didn't want your death to go in vain!

1073
01:28:00,670 --> 01:28:03,545
Killing you on… will be…

1074
01:28:05,586 --> 01:28:06,711
Sacrifice!

1075
01:28:07,503 --> 01:28:11,253
Pushed into the abyss!

1076
01:28:15,211 --> 01:28:18,961
Strained by your might!

1077
01:28:22,836 --> 01:28:27,045
Erases their identity!

1078
01:28:27,045 --> 01:28:30,878
Crushed to pulp!

1079
01:28:30,878 --> 01:28:34,420
This Hurricane stood like a bulwark!

1080
01:28:34,461 --> 01:28:38,295
His retaliation always on target!

1081
01:28:38,295 --> 01:28:42,170
Soothed by you, you Valorous!

1082
01:28:42,170 --> 01:28:46,086
Now stand with courage, gallant Fighter!

1083
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:51,711
The divine Emperor!

1084
01:28:51,753 --> 01:28:55,628
This daring Emperor!

1085
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:59,420
The divine Emperor!

1086
01:28:59,461 --> 01:29:03,878
This daring Emperor!

1087
01:29:24,045 --> 01:29:25,128
Only so much?

1088
01:29:28,461 --> 01:29:29,670
Not enough!

1089
01:29:30,378 --> 01:29:32,003
Pick up the pace, work shouldn't stop!

1090
01:29:40,045 --> 01:29:41,878
In the upcoming General Election

1091
01:29:42,378 --> 01:29:45,920
Ramika Sen will win
by a historical margin.

1092
01:29:46,711 --> 01:29:48,836
She should not contest that election.

1093
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:50,503
Don't get me wrong.

1094
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,711
It doesn't mean that my thirst for blood
has receded.

1095
01:29:54,253 --> 01:29:55,545
Even criminals

1096
01:29:55,795 --> 01:29:57,545
should have some ethics.

1097
01:29:59,503 --> 01:30:02,253
Women and children shouldn't be harmed.

1098
01:30:03,086 --> 01:30:04,878
Your story has an interesting beginning.

1099
01:30:05,295 --> 01:30:06,586
She will be your nemesis.

1100
01:30:07,378 --> 01:30:10,170
That's fine! It will be fun
to have a bit of action in the end.

1101
01:30:11,378 --> 01:30:13,836
Listen to me…don't spare her.

1102
01:30:14,628 --> 01:30:16,045
Better to avoid her wrath!

1103
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,836
History teaches us…

1104
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:24,711
never offend an infuriated woman.

1105
01:30:25,295 --> 01:30:28,378
One should ornate her and…

1106
01:30:32,378 --> 01:30:33,670
worship her!

1107
01:30:45,003 --> 01:30:48,670
He stood, this Wild Warrior!

1108
01:30:48,711 --> 01:30:52,503
With throbbing nerves we stand!

1109
01:30:52,628 --> 01:30:56,378
This Wild Warrior!

1110
01:30:56,420 --> 01:31:00,211
With our heads held high!

1111
01:31:00,253 --> 01:31:03,878
To burn the conflict!

1112
01:31:03,878 --> 01:31:07,795
Like a hurricane!

1113
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:11,921
Soothed by you, you Valorous!

1114
01:31:11,961 --> 01:31:15,920
Now stand with courage, gallant Fighter!

1115
01:31:17,586 --> 01:31:21,461
The divine Emperor!

1116
01:31:21,461 --> 01:31:25,461
This daring Emperor!

1117
01:31:25,461 --> 01:31:29,086
The divine Emperor!

1118
01:31:29,128 --> 01:31:33,128
This daring Emperor!

1119
01:31:45,795 --> 01:31:47,753
Despite all the hurdles

1120
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:49,753
he had accomplished his goals…

1121
01:31:50,586 --> 01:31:51,586
what else is the problem?

1122
01:31:51,753 --> 01:31:54,253
Yes. Rocky had built for himself

1123
01:31:54,295 --> 01:31:56,961
the most indestructible empire on earth.

1124
01:31:57,670 --> 01:31:58,753
But there was one person

1125
01:31:59,795 --> 01:32:00,961
only one person

1126
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:02,670
who could bring him

1127
01:32:03,045 --> 01:32:04,295
and KGF…down!

1128
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:17,836
I

1129
01:32:18,336 --> 01:32:18,920
I…

1130
01:32:19,295 --> 01:32:20,336
Ramika Sen

1131
01:32:22,211 --> 01:32:24,295
do swear in the name of God

1132
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:27,878
and solemnly affirm that to the
Constitution of India…

1133
01:32:28,128 --> 01:32:29,461
We need to fire the Home Minister.

1134
01:32:29,628 --> 01:32:30,086
Madam!

1135
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:32,545
he has huge support of other people madam.

1136
01:32:32,545 --> 01:32:34,545
then I think we need to fire
the entire cabinet.

1137
01:32:34,878 --> 01:32:38,003
I will bear…true faith and allegiance.

1138
01:32:40,086 --> 01:32:43,378
I will uphold the sovereignty
and integrity of India.

1139
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:48,586
As the Prime Minister of the Union…

1140
01:32:48,836 --> 01:32:51,086
Are you trying tell me how
to run this country?

1141
01:32:51,336 --> 01:32:52,336
Of course not!

1142
01:32:53,336 --> 01:32:55,795
I will faithfully…

1143
01:32:56,503 --> 01:32:58,336
and with a clear conscience…

1144
01:32:59,545 --> 01:33:00,836
discharge the duties.

1145
01:33:02,211 --> 01:33:05,045
Fearing her, every government office

1146
01:33:05,086 --> 01:33:06,753
worked beyond its capabilities.

1147
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:08,920
She was ruthless…

1148
01:33:09,211 --> 01:33:10,378
she was unforgiving…

1149
01:33:10,836 --> 01:33:12,211
she was a Dictator!

1150
01:33:13,086 --> 01:33:14,461
She was here to bring hope…

1151
01:33:15,336 --> 01:33:16,378
and she was here…

1152
01:33:16,878 --> 01:33:18,086
to bring a change.

1153
01:33:21,628 --> 01:33:24,586
-OK OK…Oh?--
-Madam has come.

1154
01:33:24,961 --> 01:33:25,878
Madam…madam!

1155
01:33:26,045 --> 01:33:27,836
I'm trying to meet you for
the last few days

1156
01:33:27,878 --> 01:33:28,670
Ah Yes Raghavan.

1157
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:30,336
Kalraji was mentioning…

1158
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:32,211
Heard there is a problem
in your state Karnataka

1159
01:33:32,211 --> 01:33:34,086
-Yes madam, regarding that--
-Ah Kalraji

1160
01:33:34,086 --> 01:33:36,211
Haven't we stationed our Special Forces
in Karnataka?

1161
01:33:36,211 --> 01:33:37,086
-Yes madam--
-Do one thing.

1162
01:33:37,128 --> 01:33:39,420
-Send them to this…KGF--
-Sure madam.

1163
01:33:39,753 --> 01:33:41,795
-That should handle your problem--
-No No! No ma'am!

1164
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,211
-I want to talk to you about KGF ma’am--
-May be later Raghavan.

1165
01:33:44,503 --> 01:33:46,128
Madam, I want to talk to you about Rocky!

1166
01:33:47,503 --> 01:33:49,836
I have bigger national issues
to deal with Raghavan.

1167
01:33:50,295 --> 01:33:52,795
I don’t have time for
small time criminals.

1168
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:54,920
This is a state matter
and they will handle it.

1169
01:33:55,211 --> 01:33:56,878
No! No! Just five minutes ma’am.

1170
01:33:57,086 --> 01:33:57,920
Please ma'am!

1171
01:33:59,003 --> 01:34:00,086
Ramika!

1172
01:34:05,961 --> 01:34:07,003
For the past 25 years now…

1173
01:34:07,003 --> 01:34:08,670
I have been studying KGF.

1174
01:34:09,170 --> 01:34:13,420
In anticipation that someone like you
would come, assess him and take action.

1175
01:34:14,128 --> 01:34:15,753
Give me ten minutes…I will explain.

1176
01:34:16,336 --> 01:34:17,336
Not just in Karnataka…

1177
01:34:17,461 --> 01:34:20,628
he operates across 21 states
and nine union territories.

1178
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:22,628
He is the biggest criminal.

1179
01:34:22,878 --> 01:34:24,211
He is the biggest businessman.

1180
01:34:24,461 --> 01:34:26,170
This is the biggest national issue

1181
01:34:26,628 --> 01:34:27,795
and only you can handle it

1182
01:34:29,045 --> 01:34:29,711
ma'am.

1183
01:34:32,378 --> 01:34:34,378
Rocky is never seen anywhere

1184
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:36,711
Until now, not even a single photo
of him is available.

1185
01:34:37,086 --> 01:34:39,003
But his name is known all around.

1186
01:34:39,336 --> 01:34:39,920
Ramesh!

1187
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:42,586
Madam…he owns many planes and
hundreds of boats.

1188
01:34:42,795 --> 01:34:43,920
control over all the ports.

1189
01:34:44,128 --> 01:34:45,211
Along with Bombay Refinery

1190
01:34:45,461 --> 01:34:48,211
he has access to all the big jewellers
of the country.

1191
01:34:49,045 --> 01:34:50,836
-Where is he from?
-Bombay.

1192
01:34:52,628 --> 01:34:54,336
Information about him is very limited.

1193
01:34:54,753 --> 01:34:56,295
But he went through lot of struggles
earlier on.

1194
01:34:56,711 --> 01:34:59,003
They hit him…as he was a newbie in town.

1195
01:35:01,795 --> 01:35:03,045
Hit him when he ate…

1196
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:06,045
hit him when he slept

1197
01:35:06,086 --> 01:35:07,211
This place is mine!

1198
01:35:08,211 --> 01:35:09,753
Hit him when he looked them in the eye

1199
01:35:10,461 --> 01:35:11,920
and when he retorted.

1200
01:35:14,128 --> 01:35:15,920
Hit him when he rebelled.

1201
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,628
But one fine day…

1202
01:35:26,170 --> 01:35:27,336
he hit back!

1203
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:37,336
From then on, no one dared to…

1204
01:35:37,545 --> 01:35:38,961
oppose him!

1205
01:36:00,545 --> 01:36:03,628
The special forces you sent…
are no match for him.

1206
01:36:03,878 --> 01:36:04,586
Why?

1207
01:36:13,378 --> 01:36:14,336
He has…

1208
01:36:14,961 --> 01:36:16,920
a very big army.

1209
01:36:23,961 --> 01:36:27,628
In the surroundings areas,
for around 1.5 million people

1210
01:36:27,753 --> 01:36:28,878
he is God!

1211
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:37,503
Before we break the barriers to reach him…

1212
01:36:37,753 --> 01:36:39,878
we have to get past
these 1.5 million people.

1213
01:36:44,878 --> 01:36:45,920
They’ll get killed…

1214
01:36:46,211 --> 01:36:47,586
or they will kill!

1215
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:51,336
But they will never let
any harm befall Rocky!

1216
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:52,795
Go back! Go back!

1217
01:37:07,670 --> 01:37:09,586
He started from the shores of Bombay

1218
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,211
took control of KGF and grew multifold.

1219
01:37:13,795 --> 01:37:15,711
He seized the entire country!

1220
01:37:16,295 --> 01:37:17,336
But until now…

1221
01:37:17,503 --> 01:37:20,003
no one knows what he has done
to that place.

1222
01:37:20,295 --> 01:37:22,003
Because forget about going there by road,

1223
01:37:22,295 --> 01:37:25,003
he didn’t even allow commercial flights
to fly over KGF.

1224
01:37:27,336 --> 01:37:29,503
But…recently we have received a photo

1225
01:37:29,795 --> 01:37:33,170
from a MIG-23 Airforce jet
doing training drills over KGF.

1226
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:36,586
This is what…they have sent.

1227
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,378
History tells us…

1228
01:37:42,378 --> 01:37:43,711
that powerful people…

1229
01:37:44,753 --> 01:37:45,461
come…

1230
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:47,836
from powerful places!

1231
01:38:03,378 --> 01:38:05,336
-Is that…?
-Yes ma’am.

1232
01:38:09,086 --> 01:38:10,045
That is…

1233
01:38:10,628 --> 01:38:11,711
Rocky's…

1234
01:38:12,128 --> 01:38:13,045
KGF!

1235
01:38:31,461 --> 01:38:32,336
History…

1236
01:38:32,961 --> 01:38:33,878
was wrong.

1237
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:38,586
Powerful people…

1238
01:38:39,753 --> 01:38:41,045
make places…

1239
01:38:42,586 --> 01:38:43,461
powerful!

1240
01:39:04,295 --> 01:39:05,628
Claims he's a journalist.

1241
01:39:05,878 --> 01:39:07,420
Was clicking photos inside.

1242
01:39:07,586 --> 01:39:08,461
We've caught him.

1243
01:39:10,545 --> 01:39:12,670
So you are…Rocky?

1244
01:39:13,211 --> 01:39:15,586
The world may turn a blind eye
towards your atrocities.

1245
01:39:15,961 --> 01:39:16,961
But I will write about you…

1246
01:39:17,211 --> 01:39:18,753
and reveal your true colors!

1247
01:39:21,170 --> 01:39:22,003
Say it again…

1248
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,295
The world may turn a blind eye
towards your atrocities.

1249
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:28,045
But I will write about you…

1250
01:39:28,336 --> 01:39:29,961
and reveal your true colors!

1251
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,878
Courage comes due to two reasons.

1252
01:39:50,211 --> 01:39:51,753
One reason is madness…

1253
01:39:52,253 --> 01:39:54,128
the other is honesty.

1254
01:39:54,670 --> 01:39:56,711
Madness is seen all the time.

1255
01:39:57,336 --> 01:39:59,586
Honesty is never ever seen.

1256
01:40:01,461 --> 01:40:02,045
See…

1257
01:40:02,503 --> 01:40:04,420
H-O-N-E-S-T-Y.

1258
01:40:07,378 --> 01:40:09,628
I don’t believe in history.

1259
01:40:10,211 --> 01:40:11,586
What has occurred is different…

1260
01:40:11,795 --> 01:40:13,295
from what has been written.

1261
01:40:13,961 --> 01:40:16,211
Don’t heed to hearsay and write.

1262
01:40:16,628 --> 01:40:18,295
Experience it and write.

1263
01:40:18,961 --> 01:40:20,795
It has its own value!

1264
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:27,003
Hey, give him everything he requires.

1265
01:40:36,545 --> 01:40:37,461
Bear in mind…

1266
01:40:38,211 --> 01:40:39,961
you are now in this journey with me.

1267
01:40:40,378 --> 01:40:42,003
Close down all the state borders!

1268
01:40:42,295 --> 01:40:43,295
Find his warehouses!

1269
01:40:43,461 --> 01:40:45,836
My journey is always a One-Way!

1270
01:40:47,003 --> 01:40:48,170
Arrest his associates!

1271
01:40:48,378 --> 01:40:50,086
Raid the whole of India if you have to.

1272
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:53,211
There will be Ups and Downs

1273
01:40:53,253 --> 01:40:55,378
U-turns and Dead Ends.

1274
01:40:55,628 --> 01:40:56,336
Raghavan!

1275
01:40:56,961 --> 01:40:58,420
I give you full authority

1276
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:00,795
But the speed will…

1277
01:41:01,378 --> 01:41:03,253
never decelerate.

1278
01:41:03,586 --> 01:41:05,003
Bring him down!

1279
01:41:06,253 --> 01:41:06,920
So…

1280
01:41:07,503 --> 01:41:09,670
Fasten your seat belts!

1281
01:41:22,336 --> 01:41:23,003
-Kalraji

1282
01:41:23,045 --> 01:41:23,628
-Yes madam.

1283
01:41:23,878 --> 01:41:24,420
Do you…

1284
01:41:24,836 --> 01:41:26,378
have any details about the raid?

1285
01:41:26,628 --> 01:41:27,670
I'll find out madam.

1286
01:41:48,753 --> 01:41:50,211
Every, every raid is a failure.

1287
01:41:50,211 --> 01:41:51,586
There is an information leak

1288
01:41:51,753 --> 01:41:54,045
And there is an informer in this office!
Go to hell!

1289
01:41:56,086 --> 01:41:56,670
Damn it!

1290
01:41:59,961 --> 01:42:03,311
-Hey! The motor has stopped working.
-There is a power failure.

1291
01:42:03,336 --> 01:42:04,045
Mallamma!

1292
01:42:05,045 --> 01:42:07,545
You said you will treat me royally.

1293
01:42:07,795 --> 01:42:08,795
Its very sultry!

1294
01:42:09,170 --> 01:42:10,420
Go get a hand-fan.

1295
01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:12,170
Nothing is in their control.

1296
01:42:12,878 --> 01:42:14,336
Police is here…pack up!

1297
01:42:30,628 --> 01:42:31,586
Hey Mallamma!

1298
01:42:33,461 --> 01:42:34,461
Take care of the fries.

1299
01:42:36,586 --> 01:42:41,336
Hey…run…run!

1300
01:42:41,586 --> 01:42:42,545
Damn it!

1301
01:43:18,628 --> 01:43:20,003
They have sealed the state borders.

1302
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:21,923
Our warehouses have been seized.

1303
01:43:22,378 --> 01:43:23,586
What else have you got?

1304
01:43:23,753 --> 01:43:25,510
M134…its called 1000wala.

1305
01:43:25,747 --> 01:43:27,997
Once lit…it keeps on burning.

1306
01:43:28,211 --> 01:43:30,586
Inayath Khalil has called to check
on the status.

1307
01:43:30,753 --> 01:43:32,461
Sir, MMG…German make.

1308
01:43:32,503 --> 01:43:33,836
Sprays bullets

1309
01:43:33,989 --> 01:43:35,155
like water from a spray can.

1310
01:43:35,211 --> 01:43:36,378
Umm…

1311
01:43:38,308 --> 01:43:40,808
Have to tread cautiously with Ramika Sen.
Otherwise…

1312
01:43:40,869 --> 01:43:42,619
Sir, I have another gun.

1313
01:43:42,826 --> 01:43:44,228
DUSHKA…Soviet make.

1314
01:43:44,618 --> 01:43:46,689
It mounts on a big tripod.

1315
01:43:46,946 --> 01:43:48,863
We call it…the BIG MOMMA!

1316
01:43:49,532 --> 01:43:51,017
When BIG MOMMA yells

1317
01:43:51,702 --> 01:43:53,161
tremors are felt all over.

1318
01:43:54,235 --> 01:43:56,212
Rather than giving a flying kiss…

1319
01:43:57,871 --> 01:43:59,728
I prefer to hug and cuddle.

1320
01:44:00,028 --> 01:44:01,653
Just now in Bangalore,
there has been a raid.

1321
01:44:01,918 --> 01:44:03,293
As we had prior information

1322
01:44:03,459 --> 01:44:04,939
goods were shifted elsewhere.

1323
01:44:05,298 --> 01:44:07,173
They were 80 in number…but insufficient.

1324
01:44:07,453 --> 01:44:08,492
All they got was…

1325
01:44:08,728 --> 01:44:09,934
a single Gold biscuit!

1326
01:44:13,161 --> 01:44:14,202
Where is it?

1327
01:44:14,952 --> 01:44:17,161
The goods have been safely moved
to Mysore.

1328
01:44:17,202 --> 01:44:17,952
Not that!

1329
01:44:21,786 --> 01:44:24,202
Where is that one biscuit?

1330
01:44:28,077 --> 01:44:30,119
Did you mention the name
of your BIG MOMMA?

1331
01:44:31,702 --> 01:44:33,702
One…Two…One…Two…

1332
01:44:40,161 --> 01:44:42,952
This fanfare is overboard.

1333
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:45,536
Given that it’s the CBI,

1334
01:44:45,787 --> 01:44:48,454
to catch a petty thief

1335
01:44:48,702 --> 01:44:51,536
they put the whole department in action.

1336
01:44:51,744 --> 01:44:53,411
Hey boy! Let me clear your old dues.

1337
01:44:53,436 --> 01:44:56,228
No worries sir!
Will pick it up in the evening!

1338
01:44:56,702 --> 01:44:58,994
Finally, all they could find was
one stone.

1339
01:44:59,369 --> 01:45:00,202
What was his name?

1340
01:45:00,369 --> 01:45:01,619
Not sure about his full name.

1341
01:45:01,786 --> 01:45:04,661
But the file mentions Bombay Shooter sir.

1342
01:45:08,786 --> 01:45:11,411
Sir, sir…what was the name again?

1343
01:45:11,577 --> 01:45:13,452
Hey…go do your work!

1344
01:45:14,327 --> 01:45:15,411
Sir, please tell sir!

1345
01:45:15,744 --> 01:45:17,827
Eh…he is a native of your village.

1346
01:45:18,036 --> 01:45:20,952
Name sounded like… Bairya.

1347
01:45:25,661 --> 01:45:27,786
Sir…do you have any of his belongings?

1348
01:45:27,952 --> 01:45:30,577
Hey, you too!

1349
01:45:30,786 --> 01:45:33,327
Enough of this hype!

1350
01:45:33,834 --> 01:45:36,482
Look…what I have got!.

1351
01:45:40,744 --> 01:45:42,536
Sir…please clear my dues sir!

1352
01:45:43,369 --> 01:45:44,994
Hey, you said by evening.

1353
01:45:45,036 --> 01:45:45,994
No sir. Please pay up now.

1354
01:45:46,036 --> 01:45:47,744
-Not sure who will survive till evening!
-Aah!

1355
01:45:53,744 --> 01:45:54,369
Here…

1356
01:45:59,744 --> 01:46:00,911
Hey, I haven’t finished yet!

1357
01:46:00,952 --> 01:46:02,702
Forget the tea. Am worried about my glass!

1358
01:46:07,036 --> 01:46:08,452
Hey, who are you?

1359
01:46:11,452 --> 01:46:15,786
Bairya!…Raja Krishnappa Bairya!

1360
01:46:18,369 --> 01:46:19,952
My village calls him…

1361
01:46:20,161 --> 01:46:22,536
ROCKY BHAI!

1362
01:46:30,661 --> 01:46:32,869
Salaam Rocky Bhai!

1363
01:47:23,577 --> 01:47:25,952
Yes sir…
you wanted to test it in the field.

1364
01:47:26,661 --> 01:47:27,577
Where sir?

1365
01:47:36,786 --> 01:47:38,661
Sir…where are you off to?

1366
01:48:12,327 --> 01:48:13,911
Ah…is this the field?

1367
01:48:17,202 --> 01:48:18,744
Run…run!

1368
01:49:37,202 --> 01:49:38,036
BIG MOMMA!

1369
01:49:38,369 --> 01:49:39,286
No…

1370
01:49:41,616 --> 01:49:43,116
BIG DADDY!

1371
01:50:04,161 --> 01:50:06,244
We have seen enough wars in our lifetime!

1372
01:50:06,744 --> 01:50:07,911
Let’s treat this peacefully.

1373
01:50:08,369 --> 01:50:09,619
Send a delegation to Burma!

1374
01:50:11,049 --> 01:50:14,481
Excuse me madam. I apologize.
But CBI director has some news!

1375
01:50:21,161 --> 01:50:23,869
Am glad that our raid was not successful!

1376
01:50:24,157 --> 01:50:25,701
Just for 400gms of gold…

1377
01:50:25,994 --> 01:50:27,744
he destroyed the entire police station.

1378
01:50:27,952 --> 01:50:29,452
If it was 400kgs…

1379
01:50:30,077 --> 01:50:31,202
imagine Bangalore's…

1380
01:50:33,786 --> 01:50:35,577
Cancel the Burma delegation.

1381
01:50:36,528 --> 01:50:37,361
Call the General…

1382
01:50:41,536 --> 01:50:46,286
The Indian Government, managing
the clashes in Burma peacefully…

1383
01:50:46,536 --> 01:50:50,327
in a surprise move, has struck down
the perpetrators using military force.

1384
01:50:50,352 --> 01:50:52,119
Our correspondent Chetan Sharma

1385
01:50:52,244 --> 01:50:54,911
is ready to interview the Prime Minister.

1386
01:50:55,036 --> 01:50:57,494
As per United Nations, the Burma matter

1387
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:58,952
could have been resolved peacefully.

1388
01:50:59,079 --> 01:51:00,287
But your action was too harsh.

1389
01:51:00,662 --> 01:51:01,287
Wasn’t it?

1390
01:51:02,036 --> 01:51:02,911
Why did you do that?

1391
01:51:05,661 --> 01:51:08,411
Burma was just an example
to let everyone know.

1392
01:51:08,452 --> 01:51:08,952
Hmm!

1393
01:51:11,036 --> 01:51:13,244
-There will be no more tolerance.
-Hmm…

1394
01:51:14,911 --> 01:51:16,244
I also have forces!

1395
01:51:16,494 --> 01:51:17,286
Super!

1396
01:51:20,494 --> 01:51:21,411
Didn't you understand?

1397
01:51:21,663 --> 01:51:22,580
We call them the Army…

1398
01:51:23,244 --> 01:51:23,994
the Navy…

1399
01:51:24,286 --> 01:51:26,202
and the Airforce!

1400
01:51:27,411 --> 01:51:29,619
She is infact talking to me!

1401
01:51:31,385 --> 01:51:32,520
We shall seek and destroy!

1402
01:51:46,786 --> 01:51:48,577
Now we are neither in power…

1403
01:51:49,077 --> 01:51:50,452
nor in the opposition!

1404
01:51:51,244 --> 01:51:52,202
Madam is here…

1405
01:51:52,702 --> 01:51:53,702
She wont sit idle.

1406
01:51:54,161 --> 01:51:55,036
Inform Rocky!

1407
01:51:56,202 --> 01:51:58,202
The warning that the Prime Minister
gave Rocky was like…

1408
01:51:58,536 --> 01:52:00,119
adding fuel to fire!

1409
01:52:00,869 --> 01:52:03,369
Rocky was now about to execute…

1410
01:52:03,411 --> 01:52:04,786
his biggest plan!

1411
01:52:05,411 --> 01:52:07,619
Block the entire consignment.
Yes, you heard it right.. stop it.

1412
01:52:07,661 --> 01:52:09,327
Don’t ask the reason. Do as you are told.

1413
01:52:09,536 --> 01:52:10,911
Stop it everywhere. That’s the order!

1414
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:13,161
The black market for gold
has closed in the entire country.

1415
01:52:13,411 --> 01:52:14,619
Why has Rocky stopped it now?

1416
01:52:14,827 --> 01:52:16,827
Why is he hoarding so much of gold?

1417
01:52:23,786 --> 01:52:24,327
Boss!

1418
01:52:24,536 --> 01:52:27,202
Rocky has stopped the supply of gold
across Hindustan.

1419
01:52:27,369 --> 01:52:29,577
-What if he goes against you…
-Urgh!

1420
01:52:33,036 --> 01:52:35,494
Don't assume that he is doing this
fearing the Prime Minister.

1421
01:52:35,744 --> 01:52:37,619
No one can read Rocky's mind.

1422
01:52:37,869 --> 01:52:40,452
But by blocking gold,
he would have planned something big.

1423
01:52:40,744 --> 01:52:42,452
First, lets think how we can stop him!

1424
01:52:44,661 --> 01:52:46,119
There is only one option now…

1425
01:52:46,452 --> 01:52:47,119
Adheera!

1426
01:52:47,577 --> 01:52:48,744
Approach him now!

1427
01:53:00,619 --> 01:53:01,661
Adheera…

1428
01:53:02,036 --> 01:53:04,702
known to bend mountains…

1429
01:53:07,827 --> 01:53:10,202
Earlier you were hiding from Garuda…

1430
01:53:11,411 --> 01:53:12,786
now from Rocky!

1431
01:53:13,244 --> 01:53:16,869
In two years, he has amassed gold
equal to what we did in 25 years.

1432
01:53:17,202 --> 01:53:19,202
We are unaware of the happenings
and the security set up there.

1433
01:53:19,244 --> 01:53:20,994
Not even sure how the place looks…

1434
01:53:21,202 --> 01:53:24,494
Its impossible to set foot in his KGF.

1435
01:53:24,744 --> 01:53:26,827
He has taken your position and ruling.

1436
01:53:27,077 --> 01:53:29,411
-And here you are in a remote cave--
-Ahh

1437
01:53:31,202 --> 01:53:32,494
Mellow down.

1438
01:53:35,077 --> 01:53:36,786
My head is pounding.

1439
01:53:38,661 --> 01:53:40,161
You are right.

1440
01:53:41,036 --> 01:53:44,077
No one can set foot in KGF now!

1441
01:53:45,536 --> 01:53:47,494
Vanaram and his guards

1442
01:53:47,744 --> 01:53:50,244
will not let anyone near Rocky.

1443
01:53:50,661 --> 01:53:52,286
He will have more guards

1444
01:53:52,327 --> 01:53:54,161
and ammunition in his barracks.

1445
01:53:54,619 --> 01:53:55,661
Its tough.

1446
01:53:55,952 --> 01:53:58,036
But I will trounce him right there

1447
01:53:58,244 --> 01:53:59,411
in front of everyone…

1448
01:54:00,869 --> 01:54:02,786
in the same mines!

1449
01:54:03,494 --> 01:54:06,077
There are two ways to get there.

1450
01:54:06,327 --> 01:54:07,702
One is through the East Gate…

1451
01:54:10,577 --> 01:54:12,244
and the other is West Gate.

1452
01:54:13,327 --> 01:54:15,744
Both gates are highly secured.

1453
01:54:16,059 --> 01:54:17,892
We need a third route.

1454
01:54:18,223 --> 01:54:19,639
The mine tunnels stretches…

1455
01:54:19,952 --> 01:54:21,577
several kilometres long…

1456
01:54:22,202 --> 01:54:23,744
right out of KGF.

1457
01:54:23,994 --> 01:54:25,786
And that's our third route!

1458
01:54:26,202 --> 01:54:27,952
How do you all of this?

1459
01:54:31,536 --> 01:54:33,786
Sparing him was a big mistake.

1460
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:36,952
But he sparing me…

1461
01:54:37,327 --> 01:54:39,119
was his last mistake.

1462
01:54:39,577 --> 01:54:42,161
No matter what, he should not live!

1463
01:54:42,411 --> 01:54:45,452
For that in the last two years in KGF,

1464
01:54:45,494 --> 01:54:48,161
I have used the people working
in all departments

1465
01:54:48,161 --> 01:54:49,702
and created this map.

1466
01:54:54,952 --> 01:54:57,327
They are of no use now.

1467
01:54:58,202 --> 01:54:58,786
GUN!

1468
01:55:03,244 --> 01:55:04,161
Hey…

1469
01:55:04,837 --> 01:55:06,045
Silence!

1470
01:55:06,494 --> 01:55:07,786
Head is splitting!

1471
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:11,327
Turn the gun around.

1472
01:55:14,027 --> 01:55:15,686
This scene is for you.

1473
01:55:16,746 --> 01:55:18,949
In case you don’t find the third route

1474
01:55:19,369 --> 01:55:20,840
you will join the crowd.

1475
01:55:22,754 --> 01:55:25,879
Adheera has given up bending mountains.

1476
01:55:27,702 --> 01:55:30,161
Now he demolishes them.

1477
01:55:35,452 --> 01:55:36,327
Strike!

1478
01:55:40,498 --> 01:55:43,207
There’s water logging in the 7th Mine.
Taking time to pump out water.

1479
01:55:43,494 --> 01:55:45,411
There's no time. Hurry up!

1480
01:55:45,661 --> 01:55:46,702
Work should not get affected.

1481
01:55:46,994 --> 01:55:50,077
Also, in yesterday’s blast in Mine Four,
eighteen people were injured.

1482
01:55:50,201 --> 01:55:51,993
Not sure if they are able to work again!

1483
01:55:52,941 --> 01:55:54,286
Tch…pay their dues and relieve them.

1484
01:55:54,355 --> 01:55:57,222
-Get able men and get the work done.
-OK.

1485
01:55:58,411 --> 01:56:01,369
Or take them to the deep Mine
and shoot them.

1486
01:56:06,473 --> 01:56:07,348
Just like Garuda did.

1487
01:56:11,066 --> 01:56:13,149
You are no different from Garuda!

1488
01:56:13,981 --> 01:56:15,356
Greed has taken over you.

1489
01:56:15,522 --> 01:56:18,022
You are rebelling against the country
and also her!

1490
01:56:19,036 --> 01:56:21,405
But your work…should not stop!

1491
01:56:22,911 --> 01:56:24,827
She will destroy your KGF!

1492
01:56:25,443 --> 01:56:27,110
She will thwart your desires!

1493
01:56:28,301 --> 01:56:29,926
Followers who trust you

1494
01:56:30,959 --> 01:56:32,001
will be on the streets.

1495
01:56:33,056 --> 01:56:34,556
But your work should go on!

1496
01:56:35,514 --> 01:56:37,431
You are the one who freed them

1497
01:56:37,808 --> 01:56:39,683
and you are the one who will hang them.

1498
01:56:40,028 --> 01:56:42,109
But your work should go on!

1499
01:56:43,514 --> 01:56:44,723
What’s your intention?

1500
01:56:55,077 --> 01:56:57,202
Tell me! Why are you doing all this?

1501
01:56:58,286 --> 01:57:00,244
Brother…give me a bottle.

1502
01:57:00,286 --> 01:57:02,327
Hey…clear your old dues first!

1503
01:57:06,788 --> 01:57:08,686
Clear his old dues
and give him another bottle.

1504
01:57:09,994 --> 01:57:13,161
We will buy as many you want,
provided you agree to do a job for us.

1505
01:57:14,577 --> 01:57:16,327
Why are you doing this…

1506
01:57:19,441 --> 01:57:20,691
and for whom?

1507
01:58:53,036 --> 01:58:55,786
Hey! You are lifting the tomb…

1508
02:00:11,661 --> 02:00:12,411
Shanthi…

1509
02:00:23,619 --> 02:00:24,536
my mother.

1510
02:00:33,286 --> 02:00:34,369
A small town lady

1511
02:00:35,077 --> 02:00:36,536
with no big ambitions.

1512
02:00:38,161 --> 02:00:40,702
But before she died
she took a promise from me.

1513
02:00:41,369 --> 02:00:44,077
To keep those words,
I’m ready to be selfish…

1514
02:00:44,744 --> 02:00:45,952
to be a coward…

1515
02:00:46,161 --> 02:00:47,536
to be a killer…

1516
02:00:47,577 --> 02:00:50,036
a criminal and also a villain!

1517
02:00:51,488 --> 02:00:54,388
I am not sure if this suffices
to keep my promise.

1518
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:03,494
Her wish is my command.

1519
02:01:06,369 --> 02:01:07,994
This is the tomb you have to take care of.

1520
02:01:15,994 --> 02:01:16,869
The work must go on!

1521
02:01:17,431 --> 02:01:18,973
You insisted on this person.

1522
02:01:19,514 --> 02:01:20,181
Who is he?

1523
02:01:26,496 --> 02:01:27,496
My father!

1524
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:35,872
He never took good care of her
when she was alive.

1525
02:01:38,869 --> 02:01:41,952
Let him at least take care of her tomb,
until he dies.

1526
02:01:50,327 --> 02:01:52,536
A wind becomes a storm

1527
02:01:52,577 --> 02:01:54,952
the storm turns into a hurricane.

1528
02:01:55,036 --> 02:01:56,036
Had heard about it…

1529
02:01:57,646 --> 02:01:59,438
but saw it with my own eyes today.

1530
02:02:11,282 --> 02:02:13,657
His mother was there to get him to start…

1531
02:02:17,712 --> 02:02:19,962
now no one is there to ask him to stop.

1532
02:02:25,957 --> 02:02:28,790
The direction this hurricane would take

1533
02:02:29,290 --> 02:02:31,153
and the destruction it would cause…

1534
02:02:31,585 --> 02:02:33,388
was not known to anyone.

1535
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:26,048
Congratulations.

1536
02:03:28,579 --> 02:03:29,246
I love you.

1537
02:05:23,911 --> 02:05:24,786
Hey buddy!

1538
02:05:25,119 --> 02:05:27,036
Look…my son is now doing fine.

1539
02:05:27,286 --> 02:05:30,077
Now I’ll get him married…lavishly!

1540
02:06:23,827 --> 02:06:25,452
Make sure the surveillance continues

1541
02:06:25,452 --> 02:06:26,744
-round the clock and don’t tell…
-Sir!

1542
02:06:31,619 --> 02:06:32,286
We got him!

1543
02:06:34,134 --> 02:06:35,092
Where's the Prime Minister now?

1544
02:06:35,259 --> 02:06:36,342
We investigated

1545
02:06:36,509 --> 02:06:37,631
Rocky’s financial transactions.

1546
02:06:37,811 --> 02:06:40,780
Millions of accounts have been opened
in the name of common people.

1547
02:06:40,943 --> 02:06:43,194
All these funds are being transferred
to one Trust account.

1548
02:06:43,481 --> 02:06:44,897
The Trust has only one Trustee madam.

1549
02:06:45,525 --> 02:06:46,233
Of course!

1550
02:06:48,233 --> 02:06:49,067
-Good job--
-Thank you madam.

1551
02:06:49,147 --> 02:06:49,897
-We got him.
-Ya

1552
02:06:50,216 --> 02:06:52,155
Find the evidence linking Rocky
to the Trust Fund.

1553
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:53,525
File charges against him!

1554
02:06:54,247 --> 02:06:55,372
Let’s get him arrested

1555
02:06:55,861 --> 02:06:57,819
and parade him in public.

1556
02:06:58,202 --> 02:06:58,952
Yes madam.

1557
02:06:59,411 --> 02:07:01,536
Its been 25 years since we opened
Mine number three.

1558
02:07:01,827 --> 02:07:04,077
We've dug a mile deep
but found only stones.

1559
02:07:04,369 --> 02:07:06,119
No sign of gold yet.

1560
02:07:06,661 --> 02:07:08,911
Close it and shift the workers elsewhere.

1561
02:07:10,686 --> 02:07:11,186
Hello!

1562
02:07:18,369 --> 02:07:20,119
If there is no teacher in the class

1563
02:07:20,793 --> 02:07:23,293
kids create all sorts of nuisance.

1564
02:07:24,944 --> 02:07:26,153
Same situation in Delhi.

1565
02:07:31,989 --> 02:07:33,595
For the Principal’s position,

1566
02:07:34,202 --> 02:07:36,244
shall we apply in your name?

1567
02:07:40,327 --> 02:07:41,244
We have issued notices

1568
02:07:41,244 --> 02:07:42,619
to the respective banks.

1569
02:07:42,744 --> 02:07:45,048
We also contacted other
financial institutions.

1570
02:07:45,394 --> 02:07:48,392
Madam, someone is here to see you.

1571
02:07:48,869 --> 02:07:50,610
Not now Arjith.
No more appointments for today please.

1572
02:07:51,090 --> 02:07:51,673
Madam, its…

1573
02:07:52,036 --> 02:07:52,661
Rocky!

1574
02:08:11,793 --> 02:08:12,251
Hi!

1575
02:08:12,532 --> 02:08:13,657
I am Jimmy Carter.

1576
02:08:14,274 --> 02:08:14,857
Rocky!

1577
02:08:15,197 --> 02:08:18,197
I am the CEO of Denver Steel, Texas.

1578
02:08:18,744 --> 02:08:20,202
Sir, madam will see you now.

1579
02:08:20,770 --> 02:08:22,603
What is this CEO, dear?

1580
02:08:22,827 --> 02:08:25,548
Hmm…Boss of Bosses sir!

1581
02:08:28,249 --> 02:08:28,958
Same Same!

1582
02:08:29,209 --> 02:08:31,001
I am also…CEO!

1583
02:08:31,510 --> 02:08:33,677
Oh! wonderful…which one?

1584
02:08:36,911 --> 02:08:37,869
India!

1585
02:09:08,452 --> 02:09:09,813
It’s a small world, isn't it?

1586
02:09:10,549 --> 02:09:11,884
Can make it spin with our fingers!

1587
02:09:12,423 --> 02:09:13,590
I also have a similar one

1588
02:09:14,342 --> 02:09:15,092
made of gold.

1589
02:09:16,827 --> 02:09:18,759
Its stand too is made of gold.

1590
02:09:18,908 --> 02:09:20,700
The table underneath, also made of gold!

1591
02:09:22,126 --> 02:09:24,334
Seems you own a lot of gold!

1592
02:09:25,036 --> 02:09:25,827
Hmm?

1593
02:09:27,119 --> 02:09:28,702
Do you want me to clear
the country’s debt?

1594
02:09:29,153 --> 02:09:29,903
I'll clear it!

1595
02:09:30,952 --> 02:09:33,161
Is this a bribe…or a threat?

1596
02:09:33,733 --> 02:09:34,275
Tch tch!

1597
02:09:34,873 --> 02:09:35,582
Not at all.

1598
02:09:35,936 --> 02:09:37,032
Am here to lodge a complaint.

1599
02:09:38,036 --> 02:09:39,911
Complaint? Against whom?

1600
02:09:40,661 --> 02:09:41,369
Myself!

1601
02:09:43,244 --> 02:09:44,661
Madam, I have decided to come clean!

1602
02:09:45,035 --> 02:09:46,660
In this unjust world

1603
02:09:46,685 --> 02:09:49,227
I believe you are the one
who can help me get justice!

1604
02:09:49,744 --> 02:09:51,411
In the name of Limestone Corporation

1605
02:09:51,621 --> 02:09:52,871
in KGF

1606
02:09:53,202 --> 02:09:54,735
am involved in illegal mining.

1607
02:09:55,285 --> 02:09:57,993
I'm also into money laundering
using a Trust fund.

1608
02:09:58,350 --> 02:10:00,225
All the details…

1609
02:10:01,006 --> 02:10:01,673
are in this.

1610
02:10:02,135 --> 02:10:05,010
Get me arrested on these charges madam!

1611
02:10:06,536 --> 02:10:07,202
Madam!

1612
02:10:07,952 --> 02:10:09,327
Please don’t accept that complaint!

1613
02:10:10,352 --> 02:10:10,813
Why?

1614
02:10:11,244 --> 02:10:14,119
Madam, please try and understand!
Do not accept that complaint.

1615
02:10:14,254 --> 02:10:15,915
Are you also a beneficiary of that fund?

1616
02:10:16,202 --> 02:10:17,994
He is a beneficiary…

1617
02:10:19,629 --> 02:10:20,795
and I am too.

1618
02:10:21,256 --> 02:10:22,798
Along with us

1619
02:10:23,462 --> 02:10:25,670
also are the 200 members of our party.

1620
02:10:38,530 --> 02:10:40,364
I said you know madam!

1621
02:10:41,452 --> 02:10:42,994
Unjust world!

1622
02:10:43,241 --> 02:10:44,991
Wont let you do good

1623
02:10:45,327 --> 02:10:47,077
Wont let me be good!

1624
02:10:48,418 --> 02:10:53,126
Bet you feel the urge to shoot me
at point blank.

1625
02:10:54,885 --> 02:10:55,635
But, you cannot

1626
02:10:56,348 --> 02:10:57,014
you know why?

1627
02:10:57,619 --> 02:11:02,411
Rules, Regulations, Elections,
People, Demography!

1628
02:11:02,411 --> 02:11:04,619
This Demography is a farce!

1629
02:11:04,991 --> 02:11:06,616
Who needs it madam?

1630
02:11:07,036 --> 02:11:10,286
People need food and shelter.
Isn’t it sir?

1631
02:11:10,411 --> 02:11:11,536
Huh! Yes sir!

1632
02:11:12,192 --> 02:11:14,483
They will sell the country
for a packet of cheap liquor.

1633
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:18,227
Madam for you it is Of the people,
For the people, By the people.

1634
02:11:19,041 --> 02:11:20,374
For me it is…

1635
02:11:21,494 --> 02:11:22,702
BUY the people!

1636
02:11:24,827 --> 02:11:27,577
To nab a criminal like me

1637
02:11:27,732 --> 02:11:30,732
you have to get out of the system,
break the rules,

1638
02:11:31,036 --> 02:11:33,744
think like a criminal and then…

1639
02:11:34,043 --> 02:11:36,501
it just takes two minutes.

1640
02:11:40,986 --> 02:11:41,736
Never mind

1641
02:11:42,083 --> 02:11:43,791
I will withdraw my complaint.

1642
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:47,884
Ma’am, there’s an elderly teacher,
my close acquaintance.

1643
02:11:48,436 --> 02:11:51,061
He wants to be er…a Union Minister.

1644
02:11:51,486 --> 02:11:53,069
Please note it down madam.

1645
02:11:53,524 --> 02:11:54,441
Requesting this madam.

1646
02:11:54,821 --> 02:11:57,071
If my man is around…
can avoid my frequent trips to Delhi.

1647
02:11:57,749 --> 02:11:58,833
Please oblige…

1648
02:12:00,095 --> 02:12:03,262
A falling star…always shines bright!

1649
02:12:04,931 --> 02:12:06,931
Heard you are a good businessman

1650
02:12:07,642 --> 02:12:08,860
and a sharp one at that.

1651
02:12:09,355 --> 02:12:10,938
but you are also a criminal.

1652
02:12:11,869 --> 02:12:13,411
But some day you will err.

1653
02:12:14,236 --> 02:12:15,194
And that day…

1654
02:12:16,869 --> 02:12:19,077
I will strip you off everything…

1655
02:12:19,744 --> 02:12:20,827
your people

1656
02:12:21,114 --> 02:12:22,056
your gold

1657
02:12:22,577 --> 02:12:23,536
your fame

1658
02:12:24,369 --> 02:12:25,702
your KGF

1659
02:12:26,556 --> 02:12:28,431
and all that you desire!

1660
02:12:34,202 --> 02:12:35,702
This is a not a warning…

1661
02:12:37,017 --> 02:12:38,225
this is my promise!

1662
02:12:44,423 --> 02:12:47,556
I generally try to avert wars.

1663
02:12:48,817 --> 02:12:50,188
if I cannot…

1664
02:12:51,231 --> 02:12:52,509
I always win!

1665
02:12:54,725 --> 02:12:55,946
-Raghavan Sir!
-Ha?

1666
02:12:56,303 --> 02:12:58,553
Heard you were looking for my photo?

1667
02:12:59,411 --> 02:13:00,774
Do you want one in this classy suit?

1668
02:13:03,911 --> 02:13:05,470
See you soon!

1669
02:13:17,369 --> 02:13:18,202
He is right.

1670
02:13:18,629 --> 02:13:20,774
Criminals always think ahead.

1671
02:13:21,994 --> 02:13:23,494
Maybe I should get ahead of him.

1672
02:13:25,077 --> 02:13:28,119
I guess now I also have to
work outside of the system.

1673
02:13:33,483 --> 02:13:34,567
Got a call from Delhi.

1674
02:13:36,202 --> 02:13:37,077
Adheera…

1675
02:13:37,681 --> 02:13:38,962
has found another route.

1676
02:13:45,827 --> 02:13:46,661
Hey

1677
02:13:48,548 --> 02:13:49,423
What happened?

1678
02:13:52,248 --> 02:13:53,040
Nothing.

1679
02:13:53,693 --> 02:13:55,652
Hey…what happened?

1680
02:13:56,337 --> 02:13:58,837
I had…a bad dream.

1681
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:01,642
In that…you…

1682
02:14:04,248 --> 02:14:05,790
I am a bad dream myself.

1683
02:14:06,134 --> 02:14:07,176
What can happen to me?

1684
02:14:10,975 --> 02:14:12,309
I missed you so much.

1685
02:14:15,247 --> 02:14:16,704
Don’t leave me alone.

1686
02:14:27,036 --> 02:14:29,744
Rocky’s funeral procession is about start.

1687
02:14:30,161 --> 02:14:33,619
-Atleast a shroud to be sent from our end.
-Yes boss.

1688
02:14:49,147 --> 02:14:50,647
The route you asked for.

1689
02:14:51,037 --> 02:14:52,204
If you dig here…

1690
02:14:53,827 --> 02:14:56,702
you will reach the Mine…from there…

1691
02:14:57,184 --> 02:14:58,934
you will directly reach him!

1692
02:16:24,869 --> 02:16:27,161
Old methods begets old results.

1693
02:16:27,161 --> 02:16:28,994
Lets look to innovate. Get the turbines.

1694
02:16:29,019 --> 02:16:31,185
-They are not available here
-Get it from US…

1695
02:16:33,399 --> 02:16:34,024
What happened?

1696
02:16:34,411 --> 02:16:36,202
I am unwell.

1697
02:16:38,537 --> 02:16:39,996
Let me see…its nothing.

1698
02:16:40,254 --> 02:16:42,545
Don't worry, go home.
I will send the doctor.

1699
02:16:43,119 --> 02:16:44,869
I don’t feel like eating anything.

1700
02:16:45,731 --> 02:16:47,981
Who’s that cook? Ask him to cook properly.

1701
02:16:48,319 --> 02:16:49,653
There wont be any problem from tomorrow.

1702
02:16:49,850 --> 02:16:51,981
Fathima aunty has advised
not to walk briskly.

1703
02:16:55,619 --> 02:16:58,036
Fine, take it easy for some more days.

1704
02:16:58,150 --> 02:17:00,395
I feel like eating
something sour and tangy.

1705
02:17:08,699 --> 02:17:10,990
I'll get the entire market home.
Eat all you want.

1706
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:13,160
What's wrong with you? Eh…Come on uncle.

1707
02:17:16,736 --> 02:17:17,736
Mother is coming…

1708
02:18:44,342 --> 02:18:45,967
Wish all the good things

1709
02:18:47,232 --> 02:18:48,190
come your way.

1710
02:18:49,445 --> 02:18:51,237
Let all the bad things…

1711
02:18:53,578 --> 02:18:54,865
befall me!

1712
02:23:06,077 --> 02:23:07,660
They are attacking Rocky…

1713
02:23:07,915 --> 02:23:09,498
Our guards are getting killed.

1714
02:24:14,577 --> 02:24:16,035
Aah my God!

1715
02:27:46,369 --> 02:27:48,767
Through which Mine did they all enter?

1716
02:27:53,475 --> 02:27:54,517
Third Mine.

1717
02:27:55,869 --> 02:27:57,785
Hey Hey…don’t go my son. Don’t!

1718
02:27:58,077 --> 02:28:00,160
Listen to me. Everything will end.

1719
02:28:00,369 --> 02:28:02,910
I beg you…Everything will be destroyed!

1720
02:28:13,589 --> 02:28:14,881
Everything is lost!

1721
02:28:17,444 --> 02:28:20,277
Gone…everything is washed away!

1722
02:28:21,113 --> 02:28:22,238
The war is over.

1723
02:28:23,202 --> 02:28:24,660
Enemies are all vanquished!

1724
02:28:27,068 --> 02:28:28,443
Where is he going now?

1725
02:28:30,363 --> 02:28:31,738
One more remaining…

1726
02:28:33,767 --> 02:28:35,392
I'll tell you the story of a village.

1727
02:28:36,691 --> 02:28:38,983
One day a few dacoits came to the village.

1728
02:28:39,478 --> 02:28:41,061
They attacked and captured a house.

1729
02:28:41,619 --> 02:28:43,822
Neighbours did not bother because

1730
02:28:44,280 --> 02:28:45,572
it was not their problem.

1731
02:28:46,327 --> 02:28:48,077
Then the dacoits captured
the entire neighbourhood.

1732
02:28:48,994 --> 02:28:50,759
Even then, the rest of the village
did not react because

1733
02:28:51,134 --> 02:28:52,342
it was not their problem!

1734
02:28:53,237 --> 02:28:56,612
Eventually the dacoits
seized the entire village.

1735
02:28:58,225 --> 02:29:01,181
Those Captors…are akin to the British.

1736
02:29:01,657 --> 02:29:03,490
And that village…India!

1737
02:29:03,972 --> 02:29:06,264
We ignored them thinking that
it was not our problem.

1738
02:29:07,097 --> 02:29:11,764
That is why they ruled over us
for 250 years.

1739
02:29:12,361 --> 02:29:13,527
You see everyone…

1740
02:29:14,577 --> 02:29:16,577
paid attention to the revolving top

1741
02:29:16,881 --> 02:29:19,423
but no one noticed the string
that made the top revolve.

1742
02:29:20,035 --> 02:29:22,119
There was a mastermind behind all of this.

1743
02:29:22,410 --> 02:29:24,952
And Rocky was going to get
rid of that mastermind!

1744
02:29:30,077 --> 02:29:31,619
And now there is a similar person.

1745
02:29:32,060 --> 02:29:33,935
He will take over the entire country!

1746
02:29:39,628 --> 02:29:41,753
But I will not allow him to prevail

1747
02:29:42,033 --> 02:29:45,074
because, I am going to make it my problem!

1748
02:29:47,873 --> 02:29:49,884
Just by a single signature of mine

1749
02:29:50,102 --> 02:29:51,908
if I can bring him down then…

1750
02:29:53,745 --> 02:29:56,662
I…am ready to resign

1751
02:29:57,003 --> 02:29:59,087
from the post of Prime Minister
immediately!

1752
02:30:23,064 --> 02:30:25,272
When Suryavardhan handed over KGF
to Garuda…

1753
02:30:25,355 --> 02:30:26,564
Adheera…

1754
02:30:26,667 --> 02:30:28,814
the unseen hand started to conspire.

1755
02:30:29,072 --> 02:30:31,072
People assumed that
Adheera attacked Garuda.

1756
02:30:31,308 --> 02:30:32,933
But that hand was pulling the strings.

1757
02:30:33,483 --> 02:30:35,642
Garuda attacked Adheera…
but Adheera survived.

1758
02:30:36,003 --> 02:30:37,337
The same hand was at play here.

1759
02:30:40,321 --> 02:30:42,529
When Rocky took control of KGF

1760
02:30:42,697 --> 02:30:43,905
Adheera was called in

1761
02:30:43,933 --> 02:30:46,533
and he was shown the third Mine
by the same unseen hand…

1762
02:30:46,691 --> 02:30:48,775
Its been twenty five years since
Mine Three has opened.

1763
02:30:49,025 --> 02:30:50,025
Got a call from Delhi.

1764
02:30:52,300 --> 02:30:53,759
The loss of power in Delhi

1765
02:30:53,908 --> 02:30:56,408
and Shetty getting cosier
with Inayath Khalil.

1766
02:30:56,785 --> 02:30:57,494
The hand executed it all.

1767
02:30:59,077 --> 02:31:02,160
The same hand led Rocky to KGF.

1768
02:31:02,535 --> 02:31:05,077
The person who can bring down the mammoth
is in Bombay.

1769
02:31:05,327 --> 02:31:06,244
ROCKY!

1770
02:31:06,994 --> 02:31:10,285
Now Rocky is after this hand…to sever it!

1771
02:31:49,397 --> 02:31:50,439
I told you earlier

1772
02:31:50,999 --> 02:31:53,832
there was only one person
who could bring down KGF

1773
02:31:54,092 --> 02:31:55,009
and that was

1774
02:31:55,322 --> 02:31:57,238
Rocky…himself!

1775
02:32:04,369 --> 02:32:06,327
No one shall ever read or write

1776
02:32:06,352 --> 02:32:07,227
anything about him.

1777
02:32:08,369 --> 02:32:11,952
His name shall be erased from
the pages of history.

1778
02:32:12,368 --> 02:32:14,601
Whoever tries to intervene,
get rid of them.

1779
02:32:14,884 --> 02:32:16,509
If need be, eliminate them all!

1780
02:32:21,308 --> 02:32:22,433
Get ready…

1781
02:32:25,155 --> 02:32:26,780
I am enforcing the army…

1782
02:32:29,272 --> 02:32:30,901
and signing the death warrant

1783
02:32:31,279 --> 02:32:33,029
of the biggest criminal in India!

1784
02:32:43,517 --> 02:32:44,808
The civilians are not engaging.

1785
02:32:45,303 --> 02:32:47,136
It looks like they are all evacuating KGF!

1786
02:33:01,660 --> 02:33:02,785
Approaching the mansion…

1787
02:33:03,160 --> 02:33:05,160
Reminder…
Rocky must be taken dead or alive.

1788
02:33:06,925 --> 02:33:08,300
Armed forces entering the mansion

1789
02:33:08,782 --> 02:33:09,865
Be cautious for resistance!

1790
02:33:10,464 --> 02:33:11,589
We are outside Rocky’s room…

1791
02:33:13,861 --> 02:33:16,069
We are breaking the door…

1792
02:33:19,785 --> 02:33:21,952
The door has opened.
The forces are going inside.

1793
02:33:27,030 --> 02:33:28,864
Sir! Rocky is not here.The room is empty.

1794
02:33:29,661 --> 02:33:30,452
Repeat that

1795
02:33:30,802 --> 02:33:31,843
Rocky is not here sir.

1796
02:33:34,170 --> 02:33:35,629
There is no sign of the gold too sir.

1797
02:33:38,645 --> 02:33:39,389
Where has he gone?

1798
02:33:42,473 --> 02:33:45,553
This is Captain Suryaprathap.
Commanding officer of INS Indrajit.

1799
02:33:45,866 --> 02:33:47,325
Doing training drills in the Indian ocean.

1800
02:33:47,679 --> 02:33:48,304
Yes Captain.

1801
02:33:48,646 --> 02:33:51,062
Heard that you are in search of a criminal
called Rocky.

1802
02:33:51,342 --> 02:33:52,811
-Yes Captain.
-We got a fax.

1803
02:33:53,247 --> 02:33:54,483
Rocky is here…

1804
02:33:54,741 --> 02:33:55,825
in the Indian Ocean!

1805
02:34:05,377 --> 02:34:07,307
That day, the amount of gold
Rocky possessed

1806
02:34:07,385 --> 02:34:08,927
was bigger than anyone in the world.

1807
02:34:09,650 --> 02:34:11,850
There was only one place to hide the gold.

1808
02:34:13,939 --> 02:34:14,983
He started to that place.

1809
02:34:17,885 --> 02:34:19,551
Captain…he is most wanted criminal.

1810
02:34:19,576 --> 02:34:21,159
He should not escape at any cost.

1811
02:34:21,637 --> 02:34:22,762
Sorry to say this Major.

1812
02:34:23,364 --> 02:34:25,451
But I don’t think that he is
trying to escape.

1813
02:34:25,737 --> 02:34:26,570
What are you saying?

1814
02:34:26,836 --> 02:34:28,828
Yes, we have received the Fax from within…

1815
02:34:29,284 --> 02:34:30,828
Rocky’s ship!

1816
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:35,530
He is headed directly at us.

1817
02:34:48,902 --> 02:34:51,801
He has sent the same fax to
Americans and Indonesians.

1818
02:34:51,836 --> 02:34:53,191
Turn around the ship!

1819
02:34:57,654 --> 02:34:59,446
They are also going towards Rocky’s ship.

1820
02:35:06,776 --> 02:35:07,535
Change the channel.

1821
02:35:07,793 --> 02:35:10,613
You are about to enter international
waters from the Indian waters.

1822
02:35:11,023 --> 02:35:13,023
Turn off your engines and
prepare for surrender…

1823
02:35:17,294 --> 02:35:20,066
I repeat…turn off your engines
and prepare for surrender.

1824
02:35:20,207 --> 02:35:22,169
All the civilians have been cleared
from KGF.

1825
02:35:22,332 --> 02:35:24,461
The armed forces are also marching
out of KGF now.

1826
02:35:24,486 --> 02:35:25,527
Begin secondary incursion.

1827
02:35:25,919 --> 02:35:27,086
It’s a GO for MIG-23s.

1828
02:35:27,378 --> 02:35:28,669
They have taken off from base camp.

1829
02:35:29,945 --> 02:35:31,195
This is your last warning!

1830
02:35:31,317 --> 02:35:33,359
Turn off your engines and
prepare for surrender.

1831
02:35:33,794 --> 02:35:34,919
Or we will fire!

1832
02:35:59,003 --> 02:36:01,836
MIG-23s are closing in on our target.
ETA two minutes.

1833
02:36:07,648 --> 02:36:11,023
The bombers are over KGF.
Waiting for your final orders madam.

1834
02:36:15,997 --> 02:36:19,122
I repeat! We are waiting for your
final orders for the strike madam.

1835
02:36:19,797 --> 02:36:21,755
Rocky is not responding
to the warnings Major.

1836
02:36:21,906 --> 02:36:24,031
The US Navy and Indonesian Navy
are closing in.

1837
02:36:24,292 --> 02:36:25,542
We are waiting for your orders.

1838
02:36:52,253 --> 02:36:53,044
Orders madam…

1839
02:36:55,020 --> 02:36:55,613
Do it!

1840
02:37:03,624 --> 02:37:04,582
Doctor! Doctor!

1841
02:37:04,926 --> 02:37:05,760
What happened?

1842
02:37:08,613 --> 02:37:10,988
Seems like pneumonia!
What didn't you come earlier?

1843
02:37:11,448 --> 02:37:13,198
Also you have come in pouring rain.

1844
02:37:13,503 --> 02:37:15,586
Such carelessness towards the kids.

1845
02:37:15,711 --> 02:37:16,676
You think you are all qualified doctors?

1846
02:37:16,934 --> 02:37:17,976
It has widely spread.

1847
02:37:18,557 --> 02:37:20,932
If you don’t take your son to the city

1848
02:37:21,711 --> 02:37:22,503
he wont survive!

1849
02:37:22,528 --> 02:37:23,535
-Hey!
-Ah?

1850
02:37:24,504 --> 02:37:26,088
Am here for my son's treatment…

1851
02:37:26,465 --> 02:37:28,299
and you are commenting on his life?

1852
02:37:29,432 --> 02:37:30,590
He closes his eyes

1853
02:37:31,156 --> 02:37:32,698
only when he hears my lullaby.

1854
02:37:33,359 --> 02:37:35,151
Neither do you have right
to talk about his life…

1855
02:37:35,559 --> 02:37:36,893
nor does God!

1856
02:37:37,958 --> 02:37:40,375
That’s not what he meant. Don’t despair.

1857
02:37:40,664 --> 02:37:42,914
Your son will have a long life.

1858
02:37:45,130 --> 02:37:48,840
Despite being slaves,
some people don't mind living long.

1859
02:37:50,588 --> 02:37:51,629
But some others…

1860
02:37:52,706 --> 02:37:55,997
however short their life is, they want to
live like an Emperor!

1861
02:37:59,544 --> 02:38:01,211
Even if he dies today,

1862
02:38:01,838 --> 02:38:05,463
I'll conclude that he didn’t have the
ability to keep my words and forget him!

1863
02:38:05,839 --> 02:38:08,353
Otherwise, as long as he lives,
in this unjust world

1864
02:38:08,378 --> 02:38:09,919
to fulfill my dreams, he should be an

1865
02:38:11,468 --> 02:38:13,343
Emperor!

1866
02:38:14,003 --> 02:38:18,836
Even in your last breath

1867
02:38:18,919 --> 02:38:19,878
Fire!

1868
02:38:25,086 --> 02:38:30,628
You tread in this world

1869
02:38:39,503 --> 02:38:46,211
If the world is in flames

1870
02:38:48,461 --> 02:38:50,586
Finally, when the day of his death arrives

1871
02:38:50,794 --> 02:38:53,086
To face the world…

1872
02:38:53,086 --> 02:38:56,378
no one will get a chance
to lift his coffin!

1873
02:38:57,937 --> 02:39:01,604
Because he will walk to the grave
on his own!

1874
02:39:03,723 --> 02:39:05,098
Two incidents occurred that day.

1875
02:39:06,195 --> 02:39:07,570
That place was destroyed…

1876
02:39:12,401 --> 02:39:13,151
and so was he…

1877
02:39:17,862 --> 02:39:22,093
Mother, I will fetch you the entire gold
in this world.

1878
02:39:22,379 --> 02:39:27,879
This emperor

1879
02:39:28,211 --> 02:39:33,878
This emperor

1880
02:39:34,211 --> 02:39:39,003
This emperor

1881
02:39:39,370 --> 02:39:45,370
This emperor

1882
02:40:08,398 --> 02:40:11,227
People are born empty handed

1883
02:40:12,629 --> 02:40:15,629
and people go empty handed when they die.

1884
02:40:16,797 --> 02:40:17,505
But he…

1885
02:40:18,944 --> 02:40:20,819
he took everything along with him
when he died!

1886
02:40:30,828 --> 02:40:32,675
All the people who stood by him

1887
02:40:34,151 --> 02:40:35,738
were never betrayed by him!

1888
02:40:41,077 --> 02:40:42,119
His existence

1889
02:40:43,778 --> 02:40:45,778
will not be forgotten by people
until their last breath.

1890
02:40:50,618 --> 02:40:51,993
I will write a book about him

1891
02:40:52,478 --> 02:40:54,177
and let the whole world know about him.

1892
02:40:54,876 --> 02:40:56,418
However long it takes,

1893
02:40:56,662 --> 02:40:58,005
I will collect each and every evidence

1894
02:40:58,553 --> 02:40:59,512
and narrate with proof.

1895
02:40:59,941 --> 02:41:01,489
What do you want to say sir?

1896
02:41:02,275 --> 02:41:03,606
If he were alive today…

1897
02:41:03,834 --> 02:41:07,584
it wouldn't be a story of mythical
creatures and warriors from ancient times

1898
02:41:07,918 --> 02:41:11,543
or as a story of historical wars
and achievements.

1899
02:41:16,430 --> 02:41:18,153
A mother from a small village,

1900
02:41:18,645 --> 02:41:21,187
the story of her determination
would have been his narration.

1901
02:41:28,665 --> 02:41:31,446
He had written down how he wanted to die.

1902
02:41:31,873 --> 02:41:34,333
But I will write about
how he lived his life.

1903
02:41:35,043 --> 02:41:37,786
There is no history of
water giving rise to fire.

1904
02:41:38,402 --> 02:41:40,200
But from the tears of this mother

1905
02:41:40,821 --> 02:41:41,821
a fire was born…

1906
02:41:47,266 --> 02:41:49,349
and so was the legacy of ROCKY!

1907
02:41:49,785 --> 02:41:51,183
As you mentioned…

1908
02:41:51,920 --> 02:41:53,879
he was not a gangster sir…

1909
02:41:54,618 --> 02:41:55,493
The lone man who

1910
02:41:55,973 --> 02:41:56,806
came

1911
02:41:56,926 --> 02:41:57,692
saw

1912
02:41:57,779 --> 02:41:58,738
and conquered!

1913
02:41:59,172 --> 02:42:01,505
MONSTER!

1914
02:42:22,879 --> 02:42:26,754
Look he is here!

1915
02:42:30,745 --> 02:42:35,014
Don't stand in his way!

1916
02:42:42,544 --> 02:42:44,669
Making it rain

1917
02:42:44,766 --> 02:42:46,558
No copyrights claimed

1918
02:42:46,777 --> 02:42:48,610
The ladies love him

1919
02:43:03,568 --> 02:43:05,692
Don't stop till he finished

1920
02:43:07,411 --> 02:43:09,591
He a leader, he leads us

1921
02:43:34,100 --> 02:43:35,100
Madam, its very clear.

1922
02:43:35,293 --> 02:43:37,959
Rocky deliberately went to the same place
in the Indian ocean

1923
02:43:38,005 --> 02:43:39,931
and made the Indian Navy fire at him.

1924
02:43:40,098 --> 02:43:42,181
That's because the ocean's depth
is 20000ft.

1925
02:43:42,206 --> 02:43:43,889
We cannot extract anything from
such depths.

1926
02:43:43,977 --> 02:43:45,894
The matter that we fail to understand is

1927
02:43:45,973 --> 02:43:48,198
why Americans and Indonesians
chased Rocky.

1928
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:49,559
I am John Booker.

1929
02:43:49,802 --> 02:43:52,261
CIA…United States of America.

1930
02:43:53,446 --> 02:43:56,488
This is the signed document
by the Director of the CIA.

1931
02:43:56,584 --> 02:43:59,001
For the extradition of the criminal named
Rocky.

1932
02:43:59,519 --> 02:44:02,060
From the year 1978 and till 1981

1933
02:44:02,402 --> 02:44:04,735
Rocky has committed several crimes across
16 countries.

1934
02:44:05,004 --> 02:44:06,129
Including USA.

1935
02:44:06,654 --> 02:44:09,738
This is the file listing all his crimes
in the last three years.

1936
02:44:09,763 --> 02:44:12,261
I would advise you to look at it
very carefully.
